# Changelog

All notable changes to `axiomancer-mechanics` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Pre-1.0.0 status: minor bumps may carry breaking public-API changes
(deprecation lifecycle per `RELEASING.md`). The `package.json` `exports`
map exposes `.` (top-level barrel) and `./node` (Node.js adapter); no
deep imports are part of the supported surface.

## [unreleased]

Post-`0.11.0` content sweep closing the Phase 71 / 73 follow-up +
the mobile item-library mod-visibility helpers (single-cell at
Phase 75 + batch at Phase 76) + the **skills-always-land mechanic
shift** (Phase 80 direction (a) pure split, with Phase 78 + 79
audit pre-work) + Phase 88 effect coverage sweep + Phase 89
front-door docs fold-in.

### Changed
- **`EffectApplicationResult.rebounded` removed; `getResistStat` deprecated.**
  The `rebounded?: boolean` field on `EffectApplicationResult` is removed
  (dead since Phase 80 — never set to `true`). The `roll` field JSDoc
  corrected to "Tier 2 buff effects only." `getResistStat` marked
  `@deprecated` (zero in-repo callers post-Phase-80; removal at next minor).
  **BREAKING:** consumers reading `result.rebounded` must remove that access.

- **Phase 84 — Skill "fizzle" event + UX scrub post-Phase-80.**
  `SkillEvent` discriminated union cleaned up: dead-code
  `effect-rebounded` variant removed (zero emit path post-Phase-80);
  `effect-resisted` renamed to `buff-fumbled` (only fires on Tier 2
  buff caster fumble). `SkillPhaseEvent` mirror updated. Dead rebound
  emit block removed from `applySkillEffect`. Docs reframed
  (combat.md Effect Resistance Rules rewritten, effects.md Tier 2/3
  tables updated). **BREAKING:** consumers pattern-matching on
  `SkillEvent.kind === 'effect-resisted'` or `'effect-rebounded'`
  must update.

- **Phase 80 — Skills always-land effects (direction (a) pure split).**
  `src/Combat/resist.ts:resolveEffectApplication` rewritten so Tier 2
  debuffs + Tier 3 effects **always land**. Target-resist roll
  removed on Tier 2 debuffs (no Nat-20 rebound; no Nat-1 overwhelmed
  double-duration). Tier 3 Nat-20 miraculous escape removed. Tier 1
  unchanged (was already auto-apply). Tier 2 buff caster d20
  fumble/crit KEPT per Phase 79 D8 (caster-side variance is not
  target-resist; direction (a) only removes target-resist). The
  damage-side of direction (a) — "damage rolls separately + applies
  resistance" — is **deferred to a follow-up phase** per D1: the
  damage-resist primitive doesn't exist today; introducing it would
  expand scope. Filed as a new Pending candidate at ship-time. No
  public-surface change (fixture stays 237 runtime + 167 types);
  `GAME_STATE_VERSION` unchanged. `effect-resisted` renamed to
  `buff-fumbled` and `effect-rebounded` removed at Phase 84. Hermetic
  contract pinned at `src/Combat/e2e/phase80-always-land.engine.test.ts`
  (+6 tests: 713 net). **Revisit-if-unbalanced caveat preserved** per
  oversight-19 user note: if direction (a) feels off in playtest,
  the candidate body retains the (b) intensity-scaling and (c)
  split-resistance variants as fallback paths for a future re-author.
  Audit pre-work shipped at Phase 78 (skills, `44d3827`) + Phase 79
  (effects, `3d213bd`).

### Added
- **Phase 89 — Front-door docs fold-in for Phases 81-87.**
  README gains a "Recent infrastructure (Phases 81-88)" paragraph
  (walkthroughs, CLI codex/reset, 824 tests, per-module quickstart
  pages). `docs/api.md` gains Phase 82 CLI consumer surfaces note
  (codex + reset tabs) and Phase 87 per-module quickstart page links.
  `plan/bearings.md` extended with Phase 82/83/85/86/88 fold-ins.
  Pure docs; no engine changes.

- **Phase 88 — Effect coverage sweep (5 Phase 79 LOWs drained).**
  Five new hermetic test files expanding post-Phase-80 effect coverage:
  `src/Effects/e2e/stat-band-effects.engine.test.ts` (~12 cases),
  `src/Effects/e2e/advantage-effects.engine.test.ts` (~13 cases),
  `src/Effects/e2e/control-effects.engine.test.ts` (~10 cases),
  `src/Effects/e2e/damage-variants.engine.test.ts` (~5 cases), and
  `src/Skills/e2e/fallacy-skills.engine.test.ts` (~8 cases). Drains
  the 5 remaining Phase 79 LOW CRITIQUE rows. 824 tests total.

- **Phase 83 — Post-Phase-80 effect-application test sweep.**
  Two new hermetic test files covering the post-Phase-80 always-land
  contract: `src/Skills/e2e/phase83-skill-coverage.engine.test.ts`
  (10 cases across 8 skills + 3 primitives) and
  `src/Combat/e2e/phase83-tier2-debuff-categories.engine.test.ts`
  (15 parameterized cases: 5 Tier 2 debuff categories x 3 d20 rolls).
  Drains 12 CRITIQUE Pending rows (3 MED + 8 LOW from Phase 78 audit
  + 1 MED from Phase 79 audit).

- **Phase 82 — CLI run-loop + Codex integration (Phase 72 + 73
  consumer surfaces).** `src/CLI/game.cli.ts` Tab union extended
  with `'codex'` + `'reset'`:
  - **Codex tab** — `codexTab(store)` renders
    `state.codex.unlockedEntries` (Phase 73). Looks up each entry
    id via a one-time `codexLookup: Map<string, CodexEntry>` built
    from `EnemyLibrary` at module load (per brief D2 — no new
    public-barrel export needed since the only authored codex
    entries today live on `Enemy.journalEntry?`). Empty-state copy:
    "Your codex is empty — befriend a foe with a journal entry to
    start filling it." (verbatim from the candidate).
  - **Begin again** — `resetTab(store)` prompts full reset / keep
    character / cancel; dispatches `store.resetRun({ keepCharacter })`
    (Phase 72); surfaces the post-reset `runId` + hearth node id.
    `logState('resetRun', ...)` for walkthrough visibility per D6.

  New agent-graded walkthrough at
  `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/codex-unlock.{json,goal.md}`:
  Apprentice → fv-11 → fv-14 → fv-15 (MournfulGull) → 5 heart-defends
  → Codex tab → quit. Grades on either friendship-fires-and-codex-renders
  OR script-exhausted-with-empty-codex (per brief D3 — MournfulGull's
  AI is non-deterministic on the both-defend pattern). README inventory
  + docs/gameloop.md § "game.cli.ts" extended. No public-surface change
  (fixture stays 237 runtime + 167 types per D8).

- **Phase 81 — Walkthrough catalog expansion (Phase 65 / 80 / 68
  coverage).** Three new walkthrough pairs ship under
  `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/`:
  - `fishing-village-exploration.{json,goal.md}` — Apprentice
    exploring the Phase 65 25-node grid via the Harbor District
    sub-area (fv-1 → fv-11 → fv-14 → fv-15) to the guaranteed
    MournfulGull encounter at fv-15 (Phase 60 befriendable
    placement via the weight-1 `fvGullCrag` pool).
  - `tier2-skill-chain.{json,goal.md}` — Wanderer casts Tier 2
    `eternal-regress` in a debug-spawned combat, exercising the
    two-effect compound application (`debuff_confusion` +
    `debuff_slow`) under the **Phase 80 always-land contract**.
    Closes one of Phase 78's MED zero-coverage primitives at the
    player-experience tier. Originally scoped for Phase 66 synergy
    skills per the candidate body; pivoted per brief D2 (none of
    the 5 synergy skills ship in any preset's `knownSkills`).
  - `coastal-tyrant-befriend.{json,goal.md}` — Sage attempts the
    Phase 68 `BefriendabilityConfig` AND-composition (`hpGate:
    { belowPct: 0.4 } + requiredStances: ['heart'] + roundsThreshold:
    5`) via 9 heart-stance defends. Grades on predicate-attempt
    visibility per brief D3 (the `hpGate` axis is RNG-dependent;
    `requiredStances` + `roundsThreshold` axes are exercised
    deterministically).

  `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/README.md` inventory grew three
  rows; `docs/testing.md` § "Agent-graded walkthroughs (Phase 26)"
  gained a Phase 81 fold-in note. A new Pending candidate
  (`Phase 66 synergy walkthrough (requires preset extension)`) is
  filed at ship-time per brief D6 to close the original synergy
  scope once the preset gap is addressed.

- **Phase 76 — `previewTemplateAtAllRarities` batch helper (Phase
  75 follow-up).** Convenience wrapper around `previewTemplateAtRarity`
  for UI tooltip / item-detail views that render every-rarity-for-
  this-template comparison strips. New `previewTemplateAtAllRarities(templateId: string, playerLevel: number, rng?: () => number): Record<ItemRarity, Equipment | undefined>`
  in `src/Items/item.factory.ts`. Calls `previewTemplateAtRarity`
  four times internally and zips into a record; each rarity-cell
  uses the same `rng` so mod values across the rarity strip are
  stable per seed. Same soft-error + deterministic-rng convention
  as the Phase 75 single-cell helper (default `rng = () => 0.5`).
  Unique templates return the unique-rolled Equipment in every cell
  (Phase 75 D4 soft-coerce — caller may not know the template is
  unique). Re-exported through `src/Items/index.ts` + top-level
  barrel (+1 runtime export; fixture 236 → 237; types unchanged at
  167). Hermetic e2e at `src/Items/e2e/preview-template.engine.test.ts`
  extended (3 new cases — regular-template happy path; level-too-low
  yields all-undefined; unique template populates every cell with
  unique-rolled Equipment). Phase 76 commits: `4c6d54e` (Unit 1 —
  engine + e2e + barrels + fixture) + Unit 2 (this commit —
  docs/items + docs/api + README + bearings + CHANGELOG).

- **Phase 75 — `previewTemplateAtRarity` helper (mobile item-library
  mod-visibility).** Closes the user-jot at `b5c8165` (refined at
  oversight-15 `077979e`): mobile UI rendering `equipmentTemplates`
  shows zero modifiers per entry because templates carry only
  `baseStatModifiers` by design — rolled mods only exist on runtime
  `Equipment` from `dropItem`. New
  `previewTemplateAtRarity(templateId: string, rarity: ItemRarity, playerLevel: number, rng?: () => number): Equipment | undefined`
  helper on `src/Items/item.factory.ts` wraps `dropItem` with rng +
  rarity pinned + UI-tier soft-error semantics (returns `undefined`
  for unknown templateId / level-too-low / unique-rarity-on-regular-
  template, instead of throwing — UI code looping templates ×
  rarities cannot wrap every call in try/catch per D1). Default
  `rng = () => 0.5` (Phase 70 Coastal Tyrant deterministic-drop
  pattern) so previews are reproducible per (template, rarity,
  playerLevel) tuple — same cell across re-renders returns identical
  Equipment per D2. Unique templates soft-coerce rarity to
  `'unique'` regardless of caller input per D4. Re-exported through
  `src/Items/index.ts` + top-level barrel; fixture +1 runtime export
  (235 → 236; types unchanged at 167 per D7). Hermetic e2e at
  `src/Items/e2e/preview-template.engine.test.ts` (5 cases per D3 —
  rolled-mod count matches rarity tier; determinism per default
  rng; the three soft-error paths). Mobile UI callsite post-engine-
  release: replace the zero-mod render in the item-library matrix
  view with
  `equipmentTemplates.flatMap(tpl => itemRarities.map(r => previewTemplateAtRarity(tpl.id, r, playerLevel)))`.
  Phase 75 commits: `6e04b50` (Unit 1 — engine helper + e2e +
  barrel re-exports + fixture refresh) + Unit 2 (this commit —
  docs/items.md "Previewing rolled mods" subsection + docs/api.md
  Items block + README.md Items row + CHANGELOG bullet).

- **Phase 74 — Post-GH#65 per-foe content sweep.** Authored
  `finalBlowLines` + `causeLines` chronicle prose on the 12
  non-sandbox enemies that Phase 71 + 73 had left to a follow-up
  sweep: TidepoolCrab, SeaMistWisp, LullabyMoth, Disatree_01,
  WetHound, ForestSprite, ArgumentativeCrow, TideflukeReaver,
  HushWraith, HollowSaint, TheDisagreement, EchoOfPyrrhonia.
  6 strings per enemy × 12 enemies = **72 new chronicle lines**;
  each enemy's voice extends its existing `description` + Phase 45
  alignment archetype + Phase 49 skill rotation where present.
  Total authored coverage: **15 of 16** enemies (only `Sandbag_01`
  remains un-authored per Phase 74 D1 — test sandbox with no
  narrative weight). Per D2, no new befriendable enemies promoted
  this phase (breadth-before-depth; Tier-2 befriendable promotion
  is a separate candidate); per D3, `pactLines` not authored on
  non-befriendable enemies (only meaningful when the enemy carries
  a `friendshipReward`). Pure content; no engine touch; no
  public-surface change (fixture stays 235 + 167). Hermetic e2e at
  `src/Enemy/e2e/aftermath-lines.engine.test.ts` extended:
  registration shape pin now covers all 15 authored enemies (split
  into separate `finalBlowLines + causeLines` shape case + a
  `pactLines befriendable-only` case); regression case re-keyed
  from TidepoolCrab (now authored) to Sandbag_01 (the new
  un-authored control). Mobile presenter's `derive*Phrase`
  fallback now only fires on Sandbag_01 — the player-visible
  roster all renders engine-authored prose. Phase 74 commits:
  `fae92ff` (Unit 1 — content authoring on 12 enemies) + Unit 2
  (this commit — e2e regression case shift + docs/enemy.md sweep
  paragraph + CHANGELOG bullet).

## [0.11.0] — 2026-05-23

Six engine extensions across two arcs: the friendship-mechanic
expansion (Phases 68/69/70 — per-enemy `BefriendabilityConfig`
predicate + `FriendshipReward.alignmentDelta` closing Spec 14 Q4 +
boss-tier `friendshipReward` content on CoastalTyrant) and the
GH#65 mobile aftermath trio (Phases 71/72/73 — per-foe narrative
prose + run-loop semantics + Codex / journal-entry surface).
`GAME_STATE_VERSION` bumped twice in the cycle (5 → 6 at Phase 72;
6 → 7 at Phase 73) — both required-field additions with matching
migrators. Per-phase detail in the `### Added` section below.

### Added
- **Codex / journal-entry surface (Phase 73 — closes GH#65 ask 3).**
  Unblocks the mobile `<CombatFriendshipPanel>` "A NEW ENTRY" card
  which previously never mounted because the engine didn't expose
  any codex surface. New required state slice
  `GameState.codex: CodexState` (`{ unlockedEntries: string[] }`;
  wrapper around the array so future per-entry metadata —
  unlock-timestamp, read-status — can land additive-optionally;
  same pattern as `QuestLog`). New optional per-foe metadata
  `Enemy.journalEntry?: CodexEntry` (`{ id: string; title: string;
  body: string }`). `store.endCombat()` auto-fires the unlock on
  `outcome === 'friendship'` when the befriended enemy carries a
  `journalEntry`: the END_COMBAT reducer appends the entry's id to
  `state.codex.unlockedEntries` (de-duped via `includes()`) and the
  store surfaces `{ id, title }` as
  `CombatEndReport.friendshipReward.codexEntryUnlocked` only when
  the entry wasn't already unlocked (mirrors the Phase 69
  `alignmentShift` surfacing pattern; body is recovered at
  consumer render time via lookup against the source `Enemy`).
  New action variant `{ type: 'UNLOCK_CODEX_ENTRY'; payload: {
  entryId } }` + store method `store.unlockCodexEntry(entryId)` so
  future dialogue / map-event content can grant codex entries
  outside combat; added to `DURABLE_ACTIONS` so unlocks persist
  immediately. Phase 72 `RESET_RUN` reducer extended to preserve
  `state.codex` on `keepCharacter: true` (codex unlocks are
  character knowledge — carry across runs alongside
  `philosophicalAlignment` + `moralMeter`). `GAME_STATE_VERSION`
  bumped 6 → 7; `migrateV6toV7` defaults `codex = { unlockedEntries:
  [] }` on legacy v6 saves. Initial author coverage:
  MournfulGull (`codex-mournful-gull` — "The Catalogue of Slights";
  extends the Phase 71 list / catalogue thread), HollowEyedBeggar
  (`codex-hollow-eyed-beggar` — "They Carry What You Set Down";
  reversal-of-begging chronicle), CoastalTyrant
  (`codex-coastal-tyrant` — "The Magistrate Who Set Down the
  Circlet"; magistrate-fallen-priest chronicle). The remaining 13
  enemies in the library leave `journalEntry` undefined and don't
  unlock anything on friendship; future content sweeps author
  entries on additional enemies. Fixture bump: +2 type exports
  (`CodexEntry` + `CodexState`); 165 → 167; runtime unchanged at
  235. Hermetic e2e at `src/Game/e2e/codex.engine.test.ts` (6
  cases: empty default + friendship unlocks + de-dupe +
  no-journalEntry no-op + victory-outcome no-op + migration).
  Mobile callsite cleanup (`<CombatFriendshipPanel>` reads
  `report.friendshipReward.codexEntryUnlocked` and mounts the NEW
  ENTRY card) is consumer-side and ships post-engine-release.
  Phase 73 commits: `0dea5f5` (Unit 1 — Codex slice + journalEntry
  type + reducer + action + store + barrels + fixture + Phase 72
  RESET_RUN cross-phase update) + `3492a15` (Unit 2 — 3 authored
  journal entries on the befriendable trio) + Unit 3 (this commit
  — 6-case hermetic e2e + docs/api + docs/combat Friendship Path
  + docs/enemy Codex section + README + bearings + CHANGELOG).

- **Run-loop semantics (Phase 72 — closes GH#65 ask 2).** New
  store surface for "begin again at the hearth" flows. Mobile
  BEGIN AGAIN's full-heal + dismiss band-aid drops in favour of
  a proper engine primitive. New
  `store.resetRun({ keepCharacter: boolean }): GameState` method.
  `keepCharacter: true` preserves the character ledger (player +
  philosophicalAlignment + moralMeter + rngState), refills HP to
  maxHealth, clears `player.effects` defensively, and resets
  run-scoped state (world via `createStartingWorld()` → fishing-
  village starting node; combat null; quests empty; flags empty;
  `lastSeenAlignmentCells` undefined — observer cache resets).
  `keepCharacter: false` performs a full new-game reset carrying
  only `rngState` (don't reset the seed mid-session — that breaks
  deterministic replay). Every call assigns a fresh `runId`.
  Dispatches `RESET_RUN` through the standard
  `gameReducer → set → emit → autosave` pipeline; `RESET_RUN`
  added to `DURABLE_ACTIONS` so the new state persists
  immediately. New required `GameState.runId: string` field
  (16-char hex, matches `/^[0-9a-f]{16}$/`; Phase 35 character-id
  generation pattern; no `crypto` dependency for React Native
  compatibility). New helpers on the public surface:
  `generateRunId(rng: () => number): string` (consumers can
  supply their own rng for deterministic tests) and
  `STARTING_REGION: MapName = 'fishing-village'` (canonical
  run-start region; reuses `MapDefinition.startingNode` — no new
  "hearth" type primitive). `GAME_STATE_VERSION` bumped 5 → 6;
  `migrateV5toV6` defaults `runId` via
  `generateRunId(() => getRng().random())` on legacy v5 saves.
  Fixture bump: +2 runtime exports (`generateRunId` +
  `STARTING_REGION`); types unchanged at 165. Hermetic e2e at
  `src/Game/e2e/run-loop.engine.test.ts` (8 cases pinning the
  preserve / reset matrix + migration). Mobile callsite cleanup
  (drop the band-aid in `state/combat-mode.tsx`) is consumer-side
  and ships post-engine-release. Phase 72 commits: `013c0af`
  (Unit 1 — types + reducer + migration + action + store method
  + run-loop.ts + barrels + fixture; two pre-existing tests
  updated to expect version 6) + `66c8822` (Unit 2 — 8-case
  hermetic e2e) + Unit 3 (this commit — docs/api + docs/gameloop
  Run-loop reset section + README + bearings + CHANGELOG).

- **Per-foe aftermath narrative prose (Phase 71 — closes GH#65 ask
  1).** Three new optional type interfaces on the public surface:
  `FinalBlowLines` (`{ brutal, quiet, ironic }`) — victory final-blow
  chronicle, picked by damage-tier shape; `PactLines` (`{ quiet,
  setDown, heavy }`) — friendship-pact chronicle, picked by parley
  posture (only meaningful when the enemy also carries a
  `friendshipReward`); `CauseLines` (`{ brutal, broken, quiet }`)
  — defeat / cause-of-loss chronicle. Three new additive-optional
  fields on `Enemy`: `finalBlowLines?` / `pactLines?` / `causeLines?`.
  Engine performs no variant selection or interpolation — fields
  are pure data; consumer (mobile presenter, CLI, future UI tabs)
  picks which variant to render based on outcome shape. Naming
  note: GH#65 source text used hyphenated `set-down`; field is
  `pactLines.setDown` (TS-identifier convention). Initial author
  coverage: MournfulGull (heart-aspected wistful — "slights" / "list"
  / "catalogue" thread), HollowEyedBeggar
  (faith-pessimistic-relational — "carrying" / "rags" / "phials"
  reversal thread), CoastalTyrant (magistrate-fallen-priest —
  "verdict" / "regalia" / "magistrate" thread). The remaining 13
  enemies in the library leave the three fields undefined and fall
  through to consumer-side defaults (e.g. mobile's `derive*Phrase`
  helpers); a future content-sweep phase will author them. Fixture
  bump: 162 → 165 type exports; runtime exports unchanged at 233.
  Hermetic e2e at `src/Enemy/e2e/aftermath-lines.engine.test.ts`
  (3 cases: registration shape + voice signatures + TidepoolCrab
  un-authored regression). Phase 71 commits: `61aa06c` (Unit 1 —
  types + barrels + fixture refresh) + `9365bb6` (Unit 2 —
  content authoring on the befriendable trio) + Unit 3 (this
  commit — hermetic e2e + docs/enemy + docs/api + README + bearings
  + CHANGELOG).

- **`FriendshipReward.alignmentDelta` extension (Phase 69 — closes Spec
  14 Q4).** New optional `alignmentDelta?: Partial<PhilosophicalAlignment>`
  field on the existing `FriendshipReward` type. When present, the
  END_COMBAT reducer applies the delta to `state.philosophicalAlignment`
  via the Phase 42 `applyAlignmentDelta` clamp helper (each axis
  clamps to `[-100, +100]`; missing axes pass through). The post-clamp
  `PhilosophicalAlignment` surfaces on
  `CombatEndReport.friendshipReward.alignmentShift?: PhilosophicalAlignment`
  for consumers to render (mirrors how `applyDialogueChoice` returns
  `effects.philosophicalShift`). Phase 36's +1 `moralMeter` shift remains
  unchanged on top — friendship resolutions now optionally shift BOTH
  axes per encounter. Authoring band: ±1..±5 per axis (matches Phase
  43's dialogue / map-event delta convention). First authored deltas:
  MournfulGull `{ outlook: +3 }` (wistful empathy); HollowEyedBeggar
  `{ scope: -3 }` (re-grounds toward the relational individual). No
  public-surface fixture change (additive optional field; no new
  exported type). Phase 69 commits: `a42709f` (Unit 1 — engine
  primitive + MournfulGull authoring + 4-case hermetic e2e) +
  Unit 2 (this commit — HollowEyedBeggar authoring + docs/combat +
  docs/enemy + Spec 14 Q4 flip + bearings + CHANGELOG).

- **Per-enemy befriend predicate (Phase 68 — `BefriendabilityConfig`).**
  New public type `BefriendabilityConfig` (`{ roundsThreshold?,
  hpGate?, requiredStances?, requiredSkillUse?, defaultFallback? }`)
  + optional `Enemy.befriendabilityConfig?: BefriendabilityConfig`
  field. When absent the Phase 36 mechanic
  (`friendshipCounter >= FRIENDSHIP_COUNTER_MAX`) is unchanged; when
  present, all named predicates AND-compose to gate the friendship
  outcome. Within a list-valued predicate (`requiredStances`,
  `requiredSkillUse`) the match is existential — at least one element
  must appear in the player's combat log. New internal helper
  `isFriendshipEligible` in `src/Combat/index.ts` is the single
  decision point; `determineCombatEnd` and `isCombatOngoing` both call
  it so the two predicates stay in lockstep (per Phase 68 D11 the
  helper is NOT on the public barrel — engine consumers read
  combat-end state through `determineCombatEnd`). Counter still
  increments freely on both-defend rounds; friendship triggers only
  when all predicates pass together, so a player can "bank" defends
  past `roundsThreshold` and have friendship trigger later (e.g. once
  `hpGate` clears via damage progress). See
  [`docs/combat.md` § "Per-enemy predicate (Phase 68 — `BefriendabilityConfig`)"](docs/combat.md#per-enemy-predicate-phase-68--befriendabilityconfig)
  for the override semantics. Phase 68 commits: `99a0cc9` (Unit 1 —
  engine primitive + hermetic e2e) + `73105dc` (Unit 2 — Coastal
  Tyrant boss-tier config + befriend.engine integration cases) +
  Unit 3 (this commit — docs + bearings + CHANGELOG).
  `scripts/public-surface.expected.json` grows from 161 → 162 types
  (runtime exports unchanged at 233).

### Deprecated
- **Combat-reducer legacy aliases (`endCombatPlayerVictory` /
  `endCombatPlayerDefeat` / `endCombatWithFriendship`).** All three are
  now marked `@deprecated` in `src/Combat/combat.reducer.ts`. They
  continue to dispatch to `endCombat` (zero behaviour change); the
  outcome has always been computed by `determineCombatEnd(state)`, not
  by the function name. Scheduled for removal at the next minor bump
  (`v0.11.0` or later). Consumers calling them should switch to
  `endCombat` directly. Tooling note: TypeScript-aware editors will
  begin flagging the call sites with `@deprecated` strike-through; the
  build is unaffected.

### Changed
- **Apprentice preset `baseStats` buffed 3/2/2 → 5/5/5 (`ff53ea0`).** User-attended
  balance tuning ("just for now") — fishing-village early encounters were
  tuning out too punishing for the default starter. Lifts the baseline so the
  first map is approachable without a full enemy-side rebalance. Affects only
  `apprenticePreset` in `src/Character/presets.ts`; Wanderer (5/4/4) and Sage
  (7/6/6) unchanged. Revisit when enemy-side tuning is reconsidered.
- **CoastalTyrant gains a Phase 70 boss-tier `friendshipReward`.**
  First boss-tier authored reward; demonstrates the full
  Phase 60+62+68+69 stack on a single high-stakes encounter. `items`:
  Paradox Loop (unique circlet, `requiredLevel: 15` — endgame-aspirational
  reward the player can hold from this encounter onward) + healing-potion
  + heart-draught. `xpBonus: +75` (boss-tier weight vs the normal-tier
  +10/+15). Multi-paragraph narrative — the magistrate-fallen-priest's
  recognition + release ("you have made me a man with nothing to be king
  of"). `alignmentDelta: { outlook: +3, scope: -2 }` — recognition +
  release shift matching the archetype, inside the Phase 43 ±1..±5
  authoring band. `flagSet: 'befriended-coastal-tyrant'` (Phase 62
  convention; downstream dialogue / quest content can gate on this flag).
  The unique-item spawn uses a fixed-RNG `dropItem('paradox-loop', 15,
  'unique', () => 0.5)` so the reward is deterministic across reloads.
  Phase 70 commit: this commit. Closes the Boss-tier befriendable enemy
  candidate (Phase 60's most-named follow-up).

- **CoastalTyrant gains a Phase 68 befriend predicate.** First boss-tier
  authored `BefriendabilityConfig` (`hpGate: { belowPct: 0.4 }`,
  `requiredStances: ['heart']`, `roundsThreshold: 5`) — the
  magistrate-fallen-priest's friendship arc opens only after he's been
  brought low, the player has shown empathy at least once, and 5
  both-defend rounds have passed. Existing CoastalTyrant content
  (`philosophicalAlignment`, `procUnlocks`, `loot`, `skills`) is
  unchanged; the new field is purely additive. The matching
  `friendshipReward` content (multi-paragraph narrative + items + maybe
  `alignmentDelta`) is deferred to the boss-tier befriendable-enemy
  follow-up phase.

## [0.10.3] — 2026-05-20

Phase 58 (Spec 14 retroactive conversation-loop spec), Phase 59
(zero-residual docs gap audit), Phase 60 (befriendable-enemy content
arc — the only public-surface addition), Phase 66 (Tier 2 synergy
skills — second public-surface addition), Phase 67 (CLI quickstart
doc), plus iterate fixes addressing critique passes 24-29. Includes a
canonical **re-grounding migration guide** for consumers (e.g.
`axiomancer-mobile`) hitting "type X has no property Y" errors after
a bump — see the Migration notes below.

### Added
- **Tier 2 synergy skills (Phase 66).** New optional `Skill.synergy?:
  SkillSynergy` clause + matching `SynergyPredicate` interface (both
  on the public barrel; fixture grew 159 → 161 types). Synergy is
  evaluated by `executeSkill` after damage and before `combatEffects`;
  payload supports `bonusDamage` + `durationDamageMul` +
  `intensityDamageMul` + `resourceTokenDamageMul` (damage scaling),
  `consumeMatched` / `consumeAllResources` / `clearAllEffectsBothSides`
  (side effects), and `applyEffectOnFire` (effect type-swap). A new
  `SkillEvent` / `SkillPhaseEvent` variant `synergy-fired` surfaces
  the bonus damage, consumed effect ids, consumed-token count, and
  flag set for UI / agent rendering. **Five Tier 2 skills authored
  in the first batch**:
  - `resonance-bleed` (heart) — cross-stance duration amp keyed on
    `debuff_bleed` on target.
  - `intensity-feedback` (mind) — cross-stance intensity amp keyed
    on `buff_critical_rate_up` on caster.
  - `bat-swarm-thoughtform` (heart) — buff type-swap: consume
    `tier1_body_defend` on caster (≥5 duration) + apply
    `buff_max_hp_up`.
  - `resonance-burst` (mind) — consume `debuff_confusion` on target
    for damage proportional to intensity × duration.
  - `resonance-detonation` (heart) — apex burn; no predicate;
    consume the full combat-resource pool + clear all `ActiveEffect`s
    on both sides + deal damage proportional to consumed tokens.
  All five carry `learningRequirement: { level: 5 }`. See
  [`docs/skills.md` § "Tier 2 synergy (Phase 66)"](docs/skills.md#tier-2-synergy-phase-66)
  for the schema + per-skill table. Phase 66 commits: `25e3c28`
  (Unit 1 — engine primitive + executeSkill wiring) + `2f75ba0`
  (Unit 2 — 5 authored skills) + Unit 3 (this commit — e2e + docs).

- **Befriendable-enemy content arc (Phase 60 + Phase 62).** New
  public type `FriendshipReward` (`{ items?: Item[]; xpBonus?:
  number; narrative?: string; flagSet?: string }` — `flagSet?`
  added at Phase 62 unit 1 `adf4403`); optional
  `Enemy.friendshipReward?: FriendshipReward` field on the canonical
  Enemy shape; optional `CombatEndReport.friendshipReward?: {
  narrative? }` field on the combat report. Engine wiring: `store.endCombat()` threads the
  per-enemy reward through the `outcome === 'friendship'` branch —
  items append to `report.loot`, `xpBonus` adds to `report.xpGained`,
  `narrative` surfaces on the report for the CLI / UI. Two enemies
  ship authored rewards (MournfulGull + HollowEyedBeggar; Phase 60
  D2 — boss-tier deferred to follow-up). All additive + optional;
  existing consumers destructuring `{ outcome, xpGained, loot }`
  continue to work. Phase 60 commits: `7724c96` (Unit 1 — type +
  engine) + `6e03871` (Unit 2 — content) + `b13348b` (Unit 3 —
  hermetic e2e + docs + Knowledge-Gaps Q5 close).
  `scripts/public-surface.expected.json` grows from 158 → 159 types
  (runtime exports unchanged at 233).

- **NPC alignment observers (Phase 63).** Tree-level observation
  pattern for reactive dialogue: `DialogueTree.id?: string`
  (optional tree identifier) +
  `GameState.lastSeenAlignmentCells?: Record<string, string>`
  (additive optional cache, no `GAME_STATE_VERSION` bump per
  Phase 63 D2) + `DialogueChoice.requires.playerAlignmentCellChangedSince?:
  boolean` (reactive gate) + `DialogueContext.lastSeenAlignmentCellId?:
  string` (visibleChoices input).
  `applyDialogueChoice` writes the current alignment cell id to
  `state.lastSeenAlignmentCells[tree.id]` after each choice on
  identified trees; the gate surfaces a choice only when the
  player's CURRENT cell differs from the cached one. First
  authored use: Old Marrow's tree (`id: 'old-marrow'`) gains a
  reactive "Stand quietly. He looks up and sees who you have
  become." branch. Closes Spec 14 Q2 deferral. Phase 63 commits:
  `aa11262` (Unit 1 — engine primitive) + `664a5d0` (Unit 2 — Old
  Marrow content) + Unit 3 (this commit — e2e + docs). No fixture
  change (additive optional fields on existing exported types).

- **Quest-branch wire-in on `outcome === 'friendship'` (Phase 62).**
  `FriendshipReward.flagSet?: string` extension: when the befriended
  enemy carries the field, the END_COMBAT reducer appends the flag
  to `state.flags` (de-duped). Reuses the existing
  `DialogueChoice.requires.flag` / `visibleChoices` machinery —
  downstream dialogue branches + quest objectives gate on the flag
  with no new gate primitive. First authored use: MournfulGull's
  `friendshipReward.flagSet: 'befriended-mournful-gull'` unlocks a
  new dialogue branch on the Coastal Beggar's `greet` node
  ("I've been hearing the gulls quieter, lately."). Convention:
  `befriended-<enemy-id-stem>`. Phase 62 commits: `adf4403`
  (Unit 1 — type + reducer) + `c32e9fe` (Unit 2 — content) +
  Unit 3 (this commit — e2e + docs). Closes the Phase 60 D3 deferral.
  No fixture change (the field is on an existing exported type).

### Changed
- **Fishing-village starting map expanded (Phase 65).** The canonical
  starting map grew from a linear 10-node chain along the dockside to
  a 25-node branching grid with three sub-areas — Harbor District
  (`fv-11..fv-15`, dead-end at gull crag), Inland Streets
  (`fv-16..fv-20`, small loop `fv-17 ↔ fv-19`), and Cliff Path
  Headlands (`fv-21..fv-25`, dead-end at gull's nest). The original
  10-node spine `fv-1` → `fv-10` is preserved verbatim so all
  existing Phase 23/24 MapEventPool overrides, Phase 43
  `alignmentDelta` authoring, Phase 62 flag-gated dialogue, and
  Phase 63 observer wiring continue to function without modification
  (only `connectedNodes` extended, never replaced). 15 new
  `MapEventPool` consts registered in `FISHING_VILLAGE_POOLS`. All 8
  `MapEventKind` values now appear multiple times across the 25
  nodes. Phase 60 befriendable enemies (MournfulGull at `fv-15`
  gull crag; HollowEyedBeggar at `fv-18` back alley) are now
  discoverable in the world. No new public-API exports; pure content
  scale. See `docs/world.md` § "Demo Content (fishing-village)" for
  the layout. Phase 65 commits: `4f3b9ec` (Unit 1 — node structure +
  connections) + `e8d3b90` (Unit 2 — 15 MapEventPool authoring) +
  Unit 3 (this commit — e2e + docs).

- **`pickEnemySkill` no longer exported from
  `src/Enemy/enemy.logic.ts`** (iterate `c15d3fa`). Internal AI
  helper, never on the Enemy barrel or top-level barrel; mirrors the
  iterate-17e76b9 treatment of `applyOutlookBias`. No
  consumer-visible API change; the public path is
  `decideEnemyAction` which continues to consult `pickEnemySkill`
  internally. Phase 49 introduced both helpers; this drain closes
  the export-hygiene gap critique-25 flagged.
- **`src/Combat/e2e/combat.resolver.test.ts` renamed to
  `combat.resolver.engine.test.ts`** (iterate `7bf8115`). Aligns with
  the `.engine.test.ts` convention codified in
  `docs/testing.md:188-189`. All 33 e2e files under
  `src/**/e2e/*.engine.test.ts` now follow the canonical marker.
  Not a public-surface change; test entry-point only.

### Docs
- **`docs/quickstart.md` (Phase 67).** New single-page entry-point
  doc for someone landing on the repo without context. Covers
  module-by-module what's shipped (with Phase numbers), how to drive
  the CLI (tabs + scripted mode + walkthroughs), key in-game flows
  (combat / friendship path / map exploration / save-load /
  alignment gates), verify + deploy gates, and a "where to look when
  you want depth" table cross-linking to `docs/api.md`,
  `docs/testing.md`, `RELEASING.md`, the per-phase briefs, and
  `CHANGELOG.md` `[unreleased]` Migration notes for stale-consumer
  re-grounding. `README.md` adds a top-level cross-link. Pure docs
  assembly; no engine touch. Phase 67 single-commit.
- **Phase 64 endgame-loadout walkthrough** —
  `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/endgame-loadout.{json,goal.md}`.
  Demonstration-grade agent-graded script driving the Sage preset
  (level 15, Tier 1+2+3 skills) through a `bootstrap-paradox` Tier 3
  skill use against the Coastal Tyrant, exercising the interactions
  between Tier 3 skill content (Phase 33/44), equipped-skill rotation
  (Phase 18+30), enemy alignment AI bias (Phase 45), enemy-skill
  caster path (Phase 49), and boss combat resolution (Phase 15
  phases). NO new engine surface — pure walkthrough authoring;
  `automation/` is dev-only and doesn't ship in the published
  package per `package.json` `files`. Walkthrough README inventory +
  `docs/testing.md` agent-graded subsection updated.
- **`specs/14-philosophical-alignment.md`** — retroactive
  conversation-loop spec for the Phase 42-46 alignment system
  (Phase 58, `f103a8d`). All four open questions answered inline
  with shipped-code references; `specs/README.md` Recommended order
  gains row 14.
- **Phase 59 zero-residual docs gap audit** (`916cef8`) — single
  audit-summary commit confirming the older Docs-sweep candidate's
  9 row-groups all drained via /iterate ticks across May 19-20.
- **`docs/testing.md` "Continuous integration (Phase 56)"
  subsection** (iterate `b7a3fa6`) — names
  `.github/workflows/verify.yml`, the on-triggers, the assertion
  chain, the concurrency-group behaviour, and the
  no-publish-step-by-design caveat.
- **`spec.md` "Published npm release" Non-goal flipped to shipped**
  (iterate `0931ce8`) — 6-month-horizon entry annotated as shipped
  at v0.2.0 (2026-05-08); Non-goals replaced with the real current
  non-goal (v1.0.0 stable-API stamp before spec contracts settle).
- **Front-door currency refreshes** — `README.md` Items row gains
  Phase 37 shop economy + Phase 54 set items + Phase 60
  FriendshipReward (iterates `650f2b2` + `59a0439`);
  `plan/bearings.md` Enemy public-api block gains FriendshipReward
  (iterate `59a0439`); `scripts/README.md` Fixture section
  freshened ("HEAD, post-Phase-60: 233 runtime + 159 types" per
  iterate `9bed952`); `docs/api.md` `CombatEndReport.friendshipReward`
  surfaced (Phase 60 Unit 3 `b13348b`).
- **`src/Game/e2e/befriend.engine.test.ts` simplification** (iterate
  `e5d1799`) — Phase 60 victory-regression compound assertion
  dropped (−3 LOC; no coverage loss).

### Migration notes

**From `0.10.2` to `[unreleased]`:** none required. All additions are
optional; existing consumers continue to compile.

**Re-grounding consumer-side types.** If a consumer (e.g. mobile,
or any external TypeScript client) is hitting "Property X does not
exist on type Y" errors after a bump, the issue is almost always
**stale local type definitions drifting against the engine's
canonical shipped shape**, not a fresh regression. The table below
gives the canonical replacement for every removed / renamed symbol
the `axiomancer-mobile` consumer surfaced at issue #93:

| Symbol (consumer expected) | Canonical replacement | When removed |
|---|---|---|
| `getCoastalMap()` | `getMapDefinition('coastal-continent', mapName)` + `createMapState(definition)` | iterate `b85f509` (post-v0.10.0) |
| `WorldMap` type alias | `MapDefinition` (authored shape) + `MapState` (runtime instance) — Phase 23 split | iterate `a707316` (post-v0.9.0) |
| `Encounter.enemy` single-enemy field | `Encounter.enemies: Enemy[]` (length 1 today; designed for multi-enemy fights) | Pre-v0.7.0 — v0.7.0 already shipped the array shape |
| `DialogueChoice.id` / `.label` | Track by **index** in `DialogueNode.choices[]`; `DialogueChoice.text` is the human-readable label | Pre-v0.7.0 — current shape has `text` + `effect?` + `requires?` only |
| `DialogueNode.speaker` | Source from the parent `NPC.name` (the dialogue tree is owned by an NPC) | Pre-v0.7.0 — current `DialogueNode` carries `text`, `choices?`, `flag?` |
| `Character.mana` / `.maxMana` | `CombatState.player.combatResources` (per-stance Spec 04 tokens); the player's combat resource pool lives on `CombatState`, not `Character`. Out-of-combat there is no mana — the engine doesn't track resource carry-over between encounters. | Pre-v0.7.0 — `mana` was never on the canonical `Character` shape per Spec 06 |
| `ActiveEffect.id` / `.name` | `activeEffect.effectId: string` references back to `lookupEffect(effectId).name` (the library entry carries the display name) | Pre-v0.7.0 — current `ActiveEffect` is the runtime instance; library lookup is the canonical name source |
| `EffectStatTarget` accepting arbitrary strings | Use the canonical literal-union members (`'body'` / `'mind'` / `'heart'` / `'maxHealth'` / `'physicalDefense'` / `'magicalDefense'` / etc. — see `src/Effects/types.ts` for the exhaustive list) | Pre-v0.7.0 — tightened to a literal union per Spec 01 |
| `GameState` accessed via string index (`state[key]`) | Read explicit fields from the documented shape: `version`, `player`, `world`, `combat`, `quests`, `flags`, `moralMeter`, `rngState`, `philosophicalAlignment`. Only `flags: Record<string, boolean>` is a string-indexed slot. | Pre-v0.7.0 — explicit-fields shape since Spec 09 |

**Authoritative shape pointers.** When in doubt about what the
engine's public surface actually looks like, consult in order:

1. `src/index.ts` — the top-level barrel; this is what `import {
   X } from 'axiomancer-mechanics'` resolves to.
2. `dist/index.d.ts` (after `npm run build`) — the consumer-facing
   `.d.ts` view of the barrel.
3. `scripts/public-surface.expected.json` — the deploy-gate fixture
   (Phase 53); canonical truth from 0.10.1 forward.
4. `node scripts/diff-public-surface.mjs <ref-A> <ref-B>` — emits
   per-tag deltas in markdown form. Both refs must contain the
   fixture (Phase 53 introduced it).

For the `v0.10.2` → `v0.10.3` delta, the public-surface changes
were the Phase 60 `FriendshipReward` type addition (158 → 159) plus
the Phase 66 `SkillSynergy` + `SynergyPredicate` type additions
(159 → 161). `v0.10.3` shipped with 233 runtime exports + 161 type
exports. Phase 68's `BefriendabilityConfig` (+1 type, 161 → 162)
ships with the next bump and belongs in `[unreleased]` only.

## [0.10.2] — 2026-05-20

Phases 55, 56, 57 — PersistenceAdapter docs/contract, CI verify
workflow, enemy skill-rotation content. No new public-API names; the
public-surface fixture is unchanged (still 233 runtime values + 158
types). Consumers see this as a behaviour bump only (enemy combat
depth + a CI gate).

### Added
- **PersistenceAdapter extension pattern docs (Phase 55).**
  `src/Game/persistence/types.ts` JSDoc extended with the recommended
  pattern for async backends (preload / flush / clear lifecycle
  helpers), citing `axiomancer-mobile`'s `AsyncStorageAdapter` as the
  reference implementation. `docs/gameloop.md` persistence subsection
  gains an "Extending PersistenceAdapter for async backends" block.
- **Compile-time PersistenceAdapter contract test (Phase 55).**
  `src/test-utils/e2e/public-barrel.engine.test.ts` gains a Phase 55
  describe block asserting `nullAdapter` is value-exported with the
  canonical two-method shape, plus a `FakeAsyncAdapter extends
  PersistenceAdapter` compile-check that breaks at type-check if the
  interface shape ever drifts.
- **CI verify workflow (Phase 56).** `.github/workflows/verify.yml`
  runs `npm run verify` + `npm run deploy:check` on every pull
  request against `main` and every push to `main`. Node 20, `npm
  ci`, setup-node cache. Concurrency group cancels in-progress runs
  on the same ref. No auto-publish step (manual + attended per
  `RELEASING.md`).
- **Enemy skill rotations (Phase 57).** 7 of 16 registry enemies now
  carry a skill rotation read by `pickEnemySkill` (Phase 49) —
  Tidefluke Reaver → `straw-giant`, Hush-Wraith →
  `sorites-cascade`, Hollow Saint → `pascals-wager`, The
  Disagreement → `liars-echo`, Echo of Pyrrhonia → `eternal-regress`,
  Mournful Gull → `appeal-to-pity`, Hollow-Eyed Beggar →
  `pascals-wager`. Tidepool Crab / Sea-Mist Wisp / Lullaby Moth
  intentionally stay skill-less for early-game pacing. `docs/enemy.md`
  Skill-use table grows from 2 → 9 rows.

### Notes
- No new public-API exports vs `0.10.1`; the
  `scripts/public-surface.expected.json` fixture is unchanged (still
  233 runtime values + 158 types). Consumers see this as a behaviour
  bump only (enemy combat depth + a CI gate).
- Migration: none.

## [0.10.1] — 2026-05-20

Engine handoff to `axiomancer-mobile`, autosave throttling, release-process
artefacts, public-surface contract enforcement, Set items engine. The first
published version under the CHANGELOG-tracked release process.

### Added
- Top-level barrel re-exports `skillLibrary` + `getSkillById` from
  `./Skills` (Phase 50 unit 1). External consumers
  (`import { skillLibrary } from 'axiomancer-mechanics'`) now resolve to
  the live skill library instead of `undefined`.
- Top-level barrel re-exports the 4 Combat aggregators
  `getActiveEffectModifiers`, `getEffectiveStats`, `canAct`,
  `resolveEffectiveAdvantage` + types `AggregatedEffectModifiers`,
  `EffectiveStats` (iterate `7ee0745`). `docs/effects.md` "API at a
  glance" is now reachable from the public barrel.
- `defaultSellPrice(ware: ShopWare): number = Math.floor(ware.price / 2)`
  engine helper in the Items barrel (iterate `3ba5319`). Replaces the
  CLI-side `Math.max(1, ...)` floor that enabled a buy/sell exploit on
  price-≤-2 wares.
- `dist/<Module>/types.d.ts` now emits for all 11 modules (Phase 50 unit
  2). Pre-fix only `Items` emitted; the other 10 modules' `types.d.ts`
  files were authored as `.d.ts` and tsc silently skipped them. Rename
  to `types.ts` was the fix.
- **Set items engine (Phase 54).** New top-level barrel exports:
  - Types: `SetBonus`, `ItemSet`.
  - Engine helpers: `getActiveSetBonuses`,
    `getActiveSetBonusesForCharacter`, `aggregateSetStartTokens`,
    `applySetGenerationBonus`, `getActiveSetPassiveEffectIds`,
    `getEquippedItemSets`.
  - Library: `itemSetLibrary` + `getItemSetById`.
  - Authored sets in `itemSetLibrary`: Wanderer's Road (2-piece
    sandals + leather-cap → `+2 heart` start tokens); Iron Discipline
    (3-piece leather-cap + cloth-wrap + cloth-gloves → `+3
    physicalDefense` at 2, `+1 body/any` at 3); Scholar's Circle
    (2-piece copper-ring + leather-cap → `+2 mind` start tokens +
    `buff_critical_rate_up` passive).
  - Set bonuses are computed on-demand at `initializeCombat` +
    `generateBasicActionResources`; set `passiveEffects` apply as
    combat-lifetime `ActiveEffect`s with `remainingDuration: -1` and
    `sourceId: 'set-bonus'` (`tickAllEffects` skips the tick).
- **CHANGELOG.md + RELEASING.md** (Phase 52 — this document, plus the
  bump-and-publish flow doc at the repo root with deprecation
  lifecycle policy).
- `scripts/deploy-check.mjs` gains three new assertions across this
  release:
  - `dist/<Module>/types.d.ts` count guard (Phase 50 unit 2 — fails the
    gate if the count drops below the source-side `types.ts` count).
  - Tag / CHANGELOG agreement (Phase 52 unit 2 — fails the gate if
    `git describe --tags --abbrev=0` doesn't match the top tagged
    `## [X.Y.Z]` heading in `CHANGELOG.md`; `(unreleased)` headings are
    skipped).
  - Public-surface fixture drift (Phase 53 unit 2 — fails the gate if
    the snapshot of `dist/index.d.ts` diverges from the committed
    fixture at `scripts/public-surface.expected.json`).
- **Public-surface tooling (Phase 53).**
  `scripts/snapshot-public-surface.mjs` reads `dist/index.d.ts` and
  emits the deterministic-sorted JSON contract.
  `scripts/diff-public-surface.mjs <ref-A> <ref-B>` pretty-prints
  Added / Removed / Changed-kind in markdown form for direct paste
  into a CHANGELOG entry. The committed fixture
  `scripts/public-surface.expected.json` captures the current public
  barrel (233 values + 158 types as of this release).

### Changed
- **Autosave policy** (Phase 51) — `src/Game/store.ts` restricts
  write-through to a curated `DURABLE_ACTIONS` allowlist
  (`COMBAT_ROUND`, `LEVEL_UP`, `END_COMBAT`, `MOVE_TO_NODE`,
  `APPLY_DIALOGUE`, `SAVE_GAME`). UI-tier actions (`USE_ITEM`,
  `EQUIP_ITEM`, `ALLOCATE_STAT_POINT`, `LEARN_SKILL`,
  `SHIFT_MORAL_METER`, `SHIFT_PHILOSOPHICAL_ALIGNMENT`,
  `START_COMBAT`, `PROCESS_NODE`, `LOAD_GAME`) no longer trigger
  autosave. The constant is internal to `src/Game/store.ts` (not on
  the public barrel); consumers see fewer writes, not a different
  payload. `store.save()` and `updateCombat()` keep their
  unconditional writes per the Phase 51 brief D2 / D3.
- **`scripts/deploy-check.mjs`** is now a meaningful gate, not just an
  `npm pack` wrapper — it runs three structural assertions before the
  pack dry-run (types.d.ts count, tag/CHANGELOG match, public-surface
  drift).
- `src/Items/e2e/equipment.engine.test.ts` "Game store lifecycle"
  assertion flipped: `equipItem` / `unequipItem` no longer call
  `adapter.save` under the Phase 51 DURABLE_ACTIONS policy. (Test
  assertion correction, not an API change.)

### Fixed
- **Phase 54 Scholar's Circle set passive expiry** (iterate
  `f250ce4`). The initial Phase 54 ship applied set-bonus
  `passiveEffects` via `applyEffect` with no duration override, which
  let the passive (`buff_critical_rate_up`, default duration 4) expire
  mid-combat at round 5 — violating Spec 05e Q4. The fix constructs
  the ActiveEffect directly with `remainingDuration: -1` (the engine's
  infinite-duration sentinel that `tickAllEffects` skips), so set
  passives survive arbitrary combat lengths. Combat-end cleanup
  discards the cloned player, so persistence stays naturally
  combat-scoped.

### Migration notes
- **Consumers using `import { skillLibrary } from 'axiomancer-mechanics'`**
  can drop any local stop-gap re-declarations (e.g. mobile's
  `state/mocks/combat.skills.fixture.ts`). The import resolves to the
  live library as of 0.10.1.
- **Consumers persisting saves through `adapter.save`** see no schema
  change; the savings come from fewer write calls, not from a different
  payload. Any UI relying on "every action writes to disk" should
  invoke `store.save()` explicitly when it needs a checkpoint.
- **Consumers building custom equipment-screen UIs** may want to import
  the new Phase 54 surface (`getEquippedItemSets` for an "active sets"
  summary, including partial counts).
- **Future release authors**: `node scripts/diff-public-surface.mjs
  <prior-tag> HEAD` (once the fixture exists at both refs) emits the
  Added / Removed bullets in markdown ready to paste here. The
  `v0.10.0` predecessor doesn't carry the fixture, so this release's
  bullets were authored from the per-phase briefs; from `0.10.1`
  forward, the diff tool is the canonical source.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-05-19

The Philosophy bundle (Phases 42-49). Adds the 3-axis alignment cube +
content authoring surfaces + enemy-skill caster path. Breaking removals
for `WorldMap` and `getCoastalMap`.

### Added
- **Philosophy module (Phases 42-46).** New top-level barrel exports:
  - Engine: `bucketAxis`, `getAlignmentCell`, `applyAlignmentDelta`,
    `defaultAlignment`.
  - Constants: `AXIS_HIGH_THRESHOLD`, `AXIS_LOW_THRESHOLD`.
  - Library: `philosophicalAlignmentLibrary` (27 cells, each with
    philosopher + literary character + 3 signature fallacies).
  - Types: `PhilosophicalAlignment`, `AxisBucket`, `AlignmentFallacy`,
    `PhilosophicalAlignmentCell`, `AlignmentGate`.
- `GameState.philosophicalAlignment: PhilosophicalAlignment` field
  (Phase 42). `GAME_STATE_VERSION` bumped 4 → 5;
  `migrateV4toV5` defaults legacy v4 saves to
  `{ epistemology: 0, outlook: 0, scope: 0 }`.
- `SHIFT_PHILOSOPHICAL_ALIGNMENT` action + store action
  `shiftPhilosophicalAlignment(delta)` mirroring `shiftMoralMeter`.
- **Authoring surfaces (Phase 43).**
  `DialogueChoice.effect.alignmentDelta?: Partial<PhilosophicalAlignment>`
  +
  `MapEventPoolEntry.alignmentDelta?: Partial<PhilosophicalAlignment>`.
  Surfaced on `ApplyDialogueChoiceResult.effects.philosophicalShift`
  and `ResolveMapEventResult.effects.philosophicalShift`.
- **Fallacies-as-spells (Phase 44).** `Skill.sourcedFromCell?: string`
  + `Effect.sourcedFromCell?: string` cross-link. 4 new Tier 3 fallacy
  skills (`appeal-to-consequences`, `nirvana-fallacy`, `pascals-wager`,
  `appeal-to-fear`); 3 new fallacy status effects
  (`debuff_no_true_scotsman`, `buff_special_pleading`,
  `debuff_category_error`).
- **Enemy alignment + outlook AI bias (Phase 45).**
  `Enemy.philosophicalAlignment?: PhilosophicalAlignment` field;
  outlook-driven flip between `attack` ↔ `defend` per
  `applyOutlookBias` (internal helper; not on the public barrel).
- **Alignment-gated content (Phase 46).**
  `DialogueChoice.requires.requiresAlignment?: AlignmentGate` +
  `SkillLearningRequirement.requiresAlignment?: AlignmentGate`.
  Optional `alignment` parameter on `meetsLearningRequirement`,
  `getAvailableSkills`, `learnSkill`. Optional
  `DialogueContext.alignment?` field on `visibleChoices`.
- **Enemy-skill caster path (Phase 49).** `executeSkill` 4th argument
  `casterSide: 'player' | 'enemy'` (default `'player'`).
  `decideEnemyAction` now consults `pickEnemySkill(enemy)` before
  per-strategy dispatch. 2 authored enemy rotations (Argumentative
  Crow → `false-dilemma`, Coastal Tyrant → `achilles-gambit`).
- `ActiveEffect.sourceId?: string` (Phase 38). Last-writer-wins
  stacking on intensity / duration; tracks which item / skill /
  passive applied the effect.
- `selectCritDamage(base, reduction, bonus)` Combat helper for crit
  damage preview UIs (Phase 32 era; re-exported for power-user
  consumers).
- `buyItem` / `sellItem` shop reducers + types `ShopWare` /
  `ShopInventory` (Phase 37).
- `unlockAdjacent` world reducer (Phase 31). Discovery shifts the
  fog; unlocking lets the CLI / UI actually offer the next ring as
  navigable.
- Spec 23 (map-events) acceptance fully ticked through Phase 41 unit 3
  + Phase 43 `alignmentDelta`.

### Changed
- `executeSkill` signature gained optional `casterSide` (Phase 49 D1).
  Default `'player'` — backwards-compatible for all pre-0.10.0
  callers.
- `ApplyEffectOptions` gained optional `sourceId` (Phase 38). Additive;
  the field is `undefined` when callers omit it.

### Removed
- **`WorldMap` type** (commit `a707316`). Replacement is
  `MapDefinition` + `MapState`, the canonical split since Phase 23. No
  in-repo consumers; mobile didn't import it.
- **`getCoastalMap()` registry helper** (iterate `b85f509`,
  post-tag oversight authorization). Replacement is
  `getMapDefinition('coastal-continent', mapName)` +
  `createMapState(definition)`. Mobile call sites at
  `axiomancer-mobile/state/actions.ts:29,759` +
  `state/e2e/exploration.engine.test.ts:11` need the replacement at
  bump time (flagged in the b85f509 commit body). See the
  `[unreleased]` Migration notes for the canonical re-grounding
  table.

### Migration notes
- **Persisted `GameState`** gains `philosophicalAlignment`.
  `migrateV4toV5` runs automatically on `load()`; v4 envelopes default
  to `{ epistemology: 0, outlook: 0, scope: 0 }`. Consumers persisting
  via `adapter.save` see the new field on every save going forward.
- **`WorldMap` removal** is a public-barrel deletion. Replace with
  `MapDefinition` + `MapState`.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-16

Phases 26 → 38 surface. CLI consolidation, RN-targeted event
emitter, ActiveEffect.sourceId wiring, agent-graded test harness.

### Added
- Phase 26: `src/CLI/game.cli.ts` consolidated CLI driver with
  tabbed interface (Map / Combat / Character / Inventory / Save / Load
  / Debug). Replaces the per-feature CLIs.
- Phase 27: `--save-file <path>` flag + Save / Load tabs surface the
  persistence layer as a user-facing save slot.
- Phase 28-29: Character progression (Phase 28 levelling math, Phase
  29 stat-allocation prompt).
- Phase 30: `LEARN_SKILL` action + `learnSkill(character, skillId)`
  pure reducer + `meetsLearningRequirement` + `getAvailableSkills`.
- Phase 31: `unlockAdjacent` reducer (precursor to the 0.10.0 surface
  re-export).
- Phase 32: Crit damage formula + `isCriticalHit` / `isCriticalMiss`
  helpers.
- Phase 33-34: Docs sweep (per-module `docs/*.md` rationalisation).
- Phase 35: `Character.id` auto-generation for save-load identity
  tracking.
- Phase 36: Friendship-victory mechanics (`combat:befriended` outcome
  + +1 moral meter + half-XP / full-loot).
- Phase 37: Shop economy — `buyItem` / `sellItem` reducers, village
  MapEvent shop payload, CLI `shopLoop`.
- Phase 38: `ActiveEffect.sourceId` field on `applyEffect`.
- Phase 39: `automation/agent-vitest-reporter.mjs` custom Vitest
  reporter + `npm run verify:agent` + structured
  `automation/last-verify-report.json`.

### Changed
- Phase 26 CLI consolidation removed several per-feature CLI files
  (`combat.cli.ts`, etc.).

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-16

Phases 09 → 25 surface. Game loop orchestration, RNG seeding, package
architecture, story content, MapEvents engine.

### Added
- Phase 09: `gameReducer` dispatch spine + `createGameStore` Zustand
  wrapper + `game.cli.ts` end-to-end demo (Spec 09).
- Phase 10: Moral meter (`moralMeter` field, `shiftMoralMeter` action,
  per-clause clamping, Spec 10 acceptance).
- Phase 11: RNG seeding (`setRng`, `getRng`, `mockFixedRng`,
  `mockAlternatingRng`, `mockSequentialRng`) + `rngState` field on
  `GameState`. Deterministic test harness (Spec 11).
- Phase 12: Package architecture cleanup (`src/index.ts` barrel
  rationalised, event surface documented for RN consumers per Spec 12).
- Phase 13: ESLint fix (`eslint.config.mts` + `@typescript-eslint`
  plugin wiring).
- Phase 14: Story content — first named NPC (Old Marrow) with moral
  dialogue tree.
- Phase 15: Combat resolver split into per-phase helpers
  (round-start, action-restriction, advantage, stance-effects,
  scenario, round-end).
- Phase 17: Removed legacy Python `combat-test.py` pexpect harness.
- Phase 21: Event emitter (`createEventEmitter`,
  `GameEventEmitter`) + typed event stream.
- Phase 22: Authoring helper skills for content / character / world.
- Phase 23-25: MapEvents engine (`resolveMapEvent`,
  `MapEventPool`, `registerMapEventPool`, 8 event kinds: `encounter`,
  `interaction`, `gathering`, `rest`, `village`, `cutscene`, `hazard`,
  `loot-cache`). Phase 25 retired the legacy `processNode` surface.

### Removed
- Legacy `processNode` and `MapEvent` / `MapEventType` types (Phase
  25). Replacement is the MapEvents engine.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-15

Pre-loop final point. Last major bundle before the autonomous-loop
era began. Mobile's current pin (as of 2026-05-19).

### Added

  (Equipment engine), 05b (Equipment library), 05c (Item rarity),
  05d (Modifier catalogue), 06 (Character progression), 07 (Enemy
  library + AI), 08 (World content + hazards) all live.
- `Equipment.setMembership?: string` stub for the deferred Spec 05e.

### Changed
- (Pre-loop history — see `git log v0.6.0..v0.7.0` for the full
  surface delta.)

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-15
