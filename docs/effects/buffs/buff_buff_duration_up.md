## Description

A Tier 2 utility buff that extends buff durations. Provides a minor `rollModifier: +1`
as a live mechanical bonus. The thematic intent — extending other buffs — is not yet
mechanically implemented (it is separate from `extendRandomBuffDuration`, which is
triggered by Heart/Attack hits in the CLI).

## Data Fields

### `payload.rollModifier: 1`

Flat +1 to all rolls. **LIVE** via `getActiveRollModifier`. This is a minor live bonus.
