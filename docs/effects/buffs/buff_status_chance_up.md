## Description

A Tier 2 buff that improves the chance of status effects landing. Provides a
`rollModifier: +3` that affects resist DRs (when applying effects, a higher roll modifier
on the attacker's heart bonus effectively raises the DR against the target, or when used
by the engine for the "attacker's side" of the roll).

Currently, `rollModifier: +3` is the only live mechanic.

## Data Fields

### `payload.rollModifier: 3`

Flat +3 to all rolls. **LIVE** via `getActiveRollModifier`. Same value as
`buff_accuracy_up` (`Bertrand's Precision`), making this one of the stronger flat roll
bonuses.
