# Equipment & Items

> **Status:** Spec 05 landed — types, reducers, combat-side engine, store
> actions, CLI item prompt, and a hermetic e2e suite are all in place. The
> 50-equipment-piece + 12-consumable library is deferred to Spec 05b.

## Item Categories

Defined in [`src/Items/types.ts`](../src/Items/types.ts).

| Category | Discriminator | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Equipment | `category: 'equipment'` | Has `slot`, `tier`, optional `statModifiers`, `passiveEffects`, `onHitEffects`, `onDefendEffects`, `critStyle`, `resourceInteraction`. |
| Consumable | `category: 'consumable'` | Has `quantity` and any combination of `healAmount`, `effectId`, `inlineEffect`, `intensityOverride`, `durationOverride`. |
| Material | `category: 'material'` | Has `quantity`. Crafting is pending. |
| Quest Item | `category: 'quest-item'` | Has `questId`. |

The `Item` type is a discriminated union; `isEquipment` / `isConsumable` /
`isMaterial` / `isQuestItem` are exported type guards.

## Equipment Slots

`'weapon' | 'armor' | 'accessory' | 'head' | 'body' | 'hands' | 'feet'`

All seven slots may be simultaneously equipped (Spec 05 Q1). A
`Character.equipment: Partial<Record<EquipmentSlot, Equipment>>` map carries
the wearer's current loadout.

## Equipment Type

```ts
interface Equipment extends BaseItem {
    category: 'equipment';
    slot: EquipmentSlot;
    tier: 1 | 2 | 3;
    statModifiers?:       StatModifier[];           // folded into derivedStats at equip-time
    passiveEffects?:      string[];                 // effect IDs applied as permanent ActiveEffects
    onHitEffects?:        EquipmentProcTrigger[];   // surfaced into the Spec 03 proc roll on attack
    onDefendEffects?:     EquipmentProcTrigger[];   // surfaced into the Spec 03 proc roll on defend
    critStyle?:           'double' | 'pierce';      // default crit style (per-skill override wins)
    resourceInteraction?: ResourceInteraction;      // optional combat-start tokens + generation bonuses
}
```

### `EquipmentProcTrigger`

```ts
interface EquipmentProcTrigger {
    effectId: string;
    target: 'self' | 'opponent';
    baseChance: number;        // 0–1, fed into the same final chance formula as JSON triggers
    tier: 1 | 2 | 3;           // respects the wearer's per-cell ProcUnlocks cap
    intensityOverride?: number;
    durationOverride?: number;
    fumbleEffectId?: string;
}
```

Per Spec 05 Q6 (option A), equipment triggers SHARE the Spec 03 proc roll
machinery instead of running a separate roll. `rollForCombatEffects` accepts
an `equipmentTriggers` parameter that is concatenated onto the cell's
eligible list (with the same tier-cap filtering).

### `ResourceInteraction`

```ts
interface ResourceInteraction {
    combatStartTokens?: Partial<CombatResources>;
    generationBonus?:   ResourceGenerationBonus[];
}

interface ResourceGenerationBonus {
    trigger:      'hit' | 'miss' | 'defend' | 'any';
    resourceType: keyof CombatResources; // heart / body / mind / fallacy / paradox
    bonus:        number;
}
```

`aggregateCombatStartTokens(equipment)` sums every equipped item's
`combatStartTokens` into a flat `CombatResources` snapshot. The combat
reducer's `initializeCombat` calls this once at battle start, so a Berserker
Band-style accessory can begin the fight with `combatResources.body = 3`.

`applyEquipmentGenerationBonus(resources, equipment, outcome)` folds the
applicable bonuses on top of the base generation table from
`generateBasicActionResources` (Spec 04). `'any'` matches every outcome;
specific triggers match only the matching outcome. Negative bonuses are
clamped at zero per counter.

## Consumable Type

```ts
interface Consumable extends BaseItem {
    category: 'consumable';
    quantity: number;
    effectId?:          string;   // library lookup key
    inlineEffect?:      Effect;   // bespoke one-off effect (Q8 option C)
    healAmount?:        number;   // immediate flat HP heal (Q9 option C)
    intensityOverride?: number;
    durationOverride?:  number;
}
```

`useConsumableEffect(player, consumable, round, lookupEffectFn)` applies the
payload onto a player snapshot:

1. If `healAmount` is set, restores that many HP (clamped via `heal`).
2. If `inlineEffect` is present, applies it via `applyEffect`.
3. If `effectId` resolves into the library, applies that effect via
   `applyEffect`.

Both inline and referenced effects may be present simultaneously. The caller
is responsible for decrementing the inventory stack via the existing
`useConsumable` inventory reducer.

## Reducers

Pure functions in [`src/Character/equipment.reducer.ts`](../src/Character/equipment.reducer.ts):

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `equipItem(character, item)` | Folds stat mods into `derivedStats`, pushes passive effects as permanent `ActiveEffect`s, replaces any prior slot occupant. |
| `unequipItem(character, slot)` | Removes the slot occupant, recomputes `derivedStats` from base stats + remaining equipment, prunes that item's passive effects (filtered by `sourceId`). |
| `getEquipmentModifiers(equipment)` | Aggregated `StatModifier` bundle keyed by stat name. Same shape as `getActiveEffectModifiers`. |

`equipItem` and `unequipItem` are pure — neither mutates the input character.

### Derived stat pipeline

Equipment modifiers and effects share the same `StatModifier` shape:

```
effectiveBase     = baseStat + Σ flatMod  ×  (1 + Σ (multMod - 1))
derived (initial) = deriveStats(effectiveBase)
derived (final)   = derived (initial) per-stat patches for flat + mult mods
```

Per Spec 05 Q3 option A, equipment modifiers are baked into `derivedStats`
at equip-time, so `character.derivedStats` is always "post-equipment". The
active-effects pipeline in `getEffectiveStats` re-derives further on top of
this post-equipment baseline.

## Inventory Reducer

Pure functions in [`src/Items/item.reducer.ts`](../src/Items/item.reducer.ts):

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `addItem(inventory, item)` | Append. |
| `removeItem(inventory, itemId)` | Remove by ID. |
| `useConsumable(inventory, itemId)` | Decrement quantity; remove if 0. |
| `stackItem(inventory, itemId, amount)` | Merge stackables (consumables, materials). |

The Zustand store (`Game/store.ts`) wraps these alongside `equipItem` /
`unequipItem` / `useConsumable`, which additionally applies the
consumable's effect via `useConsumableEffect`.

## Combat resolver integration

- `initializeCombat` calls `aggregateCombatStartTokens(player.equipment)`
  instead of zero-seeding `combatResources`.
- `generateBasicActionResources(resources, stance, outcome, equipment?)`
  appends `applyEquipmentGenerationBonus(...)` onto the base-table token
  whenever an `equipment` map is passed (the combat resolver passes
  `player.equipment`).
- `runActionProcs` in `combat.resolver.ts` calls `getEquipmentProcTriggers`
  for the actor and forwards them as `equipmentTriggers` to
  `rollForCombatEffects`. Per Spec 05 Q6 these triggers participate in the
  same chance / crit / fumble math as the JSON-defined Stance × action
  table.
- A new `action: 'item'` branch in `resolveCombatRound` looks up
  `playerAction.itemId` in `player.inventory`, applies the consumable via
  `useConsumableEffect`, decrements the stack, and emits an
  `ItemPhaseEvent` (`used` or `blocked`) on the combat event stream. The
  enemy's basic action still resolves at passive defense.

## Pending (Spec 05b)

- 50 equipment pieces curated by tier and slot, with resource interactions.
- 12 consumables exercising heal / library effect / inline effect paths.
- Loot drops, shop pricing, equipment as quest rewards (Spec 07 / 08).
