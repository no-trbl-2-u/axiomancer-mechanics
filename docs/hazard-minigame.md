## Decision

The first true Axiomancer event minigame candidate is the **Hazard minigame**. It should feel closer to **Mage Knight** than to War: a compact tactical puzzle where the player reads a dangerous situation, rolls imperfect mana, draws a hand of action cards, and assembles a solution under pressure.

The system must not become simple card-number comparison. The player should solve the turn through action effects, mana manipulation, card draw/filtering, persistent enchantments, risk, and consequence.

## Design Goals

- Make hazards feel like playable crises, not passive damage popups.
- Give the player visible tactical agency after a bad roll.
- Let danger tempt the player with harder routes and better rewards.
- Keep the round outcome legible: success marks (`O`) and failure marks (`X`).
- Keep early implementation small enough to prototype and tune.
- Support Axiomancer's board-game-like event direction: constrained, legible, punishing, rewarding, and testable.

## Core Loop

1. A map node triggers a hazard event.
2. The game draws/reveals a **Hazard card**.
3. The player draws **5 action cards** from their personal deck.
4. The player sees their hand and chooses **top route** or **bottom route**.
5. **4 colored mana dice** are rolled and persist as board objects for the entire hazard.
6. The player uses action card effects and available mana to meet the round's hazard requirement.
7. Each round resolves as:
   - `O` = completed / success
   - `X` = failed
8. The minigame lasts **3–5 rounds**. Each subsequent round draws 5 new cards from the deck.
9. The last round is always somewhat harder.
10. Final score:

```text
successes O - failures X
```

11. Final score determines outcome, reward, and/or penalty.


## Expected Playthrough / UX Contract

The clickable prototype should model the intended player pass, not merely the engine state labels. A normal hazard round plays as follows:

1. The player enters a hazard from the map and sees the hazard card, scenario, round count, and the safe/top and risk/bottom routes. The exact route layout is still a UX problem, but both routes must reveal their thresholds, reward promise, and consequence risk before commitment.
2. The player's 5-card hand appears at the bottom of the screen as compact card stock. It must fit without horizontal scrolling; slight overlap/stacking is acceptable. Card stock may carry a subtle color tint based on the single mana color its bottom action can consume.
3. Tapping a compact hand card opens the readable card view with full text and keyword explanations.
4. The player drags candidate cards into a play area that can hold up to 6 cards. Cards shrink when placed there. Tapping a staged card returns it to the hand.
5. The player drags a die onto a staged card to power that card's bottom action. Cards never require more than 1 mana to power up.
6. Progress meters preview the would-be result of the staged set before commitment. The preview must show current value, projected value, and threshold.
7. The player confirms the staged set with a **Play** button. Until Play is pressed, staged cards and dice assignment are reversible UI intent, not resolved engine truth.
8. The round resolves, the `O`/`X` ledger updates, played cards move to discard/enchantment zones as appropriate, remaining hand cards are discarded, and the next round draws a new set of 5.
9. Repeat until the hazard's 3-5 rounds are complete.
10. Completion shows a result modal: **Perfect** when all rounds succeeded, **Complete** when at least 1 round succeeded, and **Failure** when no rounds succeeded.
11. A rewards/consequences modal follows the result. It shows granted rewards, consequences, and 3 card-reward choices when applicable.

Reward and consequence rules for the prototype:

- **Perfect:** 1 guaranteed rare card appears among the 3 card choices; the player may also skip card reward via an `X` button in the modal's bottom-right corner. Perfect applies 0 consequences.
- **Complete / normal success:** the player must choose 1 of 3 offered cards. Rarity ranges from common to rare by RNG, except a one-round-only success has 0% rare chance. Consequences scale with rounds lost.
- **Failure / 0 successful rounds:** no success reward; apply maximum consequences for that hazard.
- Consequences can include dead cards added to the deck, maximum VITAE loss, minimum VITAE loss, loss of all current paradox/fallacy tokens, or other hazard-authored penalties.
- Rewards and consequences may share the same modal area, but every reward and consequence needs an icon plus tooltip/explainer copy.

## Hazard Cards

A hazard card represents a dangerous situation: traps, starvation, cliff edges, dangerous terrain, corruption, collapsing structures, hostile weather, and similar crises.

Each hazard card has a **top** and **bottom** route:

- **Top route:** easier to clear, safer, lower reward.
- **Bottom route:** harder to clear, better reward, greater temptation/risk.

**Top and bottom routes use different progress types** — the routes are not the same goal at different difficulty numbers. They represent genuinely different approaches to the crisis. A hazard that forces both routes to measure the same thing is a design failure.

The hazard card's target numbers and difficulty assumptions should be balanced around a **5-card action hand**.

Example hazard skeleton:

```text
Cracked Cliff Path
Scenario: The ledge breaks underfoot and a shrine-cache glints across the split.
Top: Find footing — Clear 5 Stability.
Bottom: Leap for the shrine cache — Clear 8 Escape; better reward, injury on failure.
Rounds: 3
Final round modifier: +2 target or added penalty.
```

## Progress Types

V0 uses exactly **four** progress types. No new types until these prove readable under pressure.

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Stability | Physical balance, structural navigation, composure under pressure |
| Escape | Getting out, bypassing, finding alternate paths, speed under threat |
| Supply | Resource management, provisioning, finding materials |
| Force | Physical power, confrontation, endurance against direct resistance |

**Focus is not a progress type.** Focus is a card mechanic that buffs the progress value of other cards — see Action Cards.

Dual-requirement rounds (e.g., clear 5 Stability + 4 Force) are valid, especially on bottom routes and final rounds. They are interesting precisely because the player may not have mana in both colors.

## Mana Dice

Each hazard uses **4 mana dice**, rolled once at the start of the hazard (after route choice, before round 1). They persist as board objects for the entire hazard.

Die faces:

- Red
- Green
- Blue
- Yellow
- Purple
- X

Rules:

- Dice do **not** automatically reroll or refresh between rounds.
- Mana does **not** freely carry over by default.
- **X is blocked mana — it cannot be spent or used unless a card specifically enables interaction with X dice.**
- Cards and enchantments may explicitly reroll, refresh, preserve, exhaust, discard, lock, or transform dice.
- Specific card text is permitted to override the default dice law.

This makes dice into board objects with persistent state, not just per-round random numbers.

A die should be modeled with both color and state:

```ts
type HazardManaDie = {
  color: 'red' | 'green' | 'blue' | 'yellow' | 'purple' | 'x';
  state: 'available' | 'spent' | 'exhausted' | 'discarded' | 'locked' | 'preserved';
};
```

## Action Cards

Each round, the player draws **5 action cards** from their personal deck.

Each action card has:

- **Top action:** free to play.
- **Bottom action:** costs mana and is stronger, stranger, or more tactical.
- **Single-mana law:** no bottom action may require more than 1 mana to power up.

The action deck must include different tactical verbs. It must not be only direct progress.

### Action Card Verb Classes

1. **Direct progress**
   - Add typed progress toward clearing the hazard.
   - Example: `+3 Stability`, `+2 Force`, `+4 Supply`.

2. **Focus (buff)**
   - Add to any single progress value played this round.
   - Focus effects stack: each Focus card played before a progress card adds to its total.
   - Example: `Focus +3 — the next progress value produced this round gains +3`.

3. **Mana conversion**
   - Change one or more mana colors.
   - Example: `Change 1 mana to blue`.

4. **Mana creation**
   - Create new temporary mana.
   - Example: `Create 1 yellow`.

5. **Card draw / filtering**
   - Draw, discard, look ahead, replace, or play free top actions.
   - Example: `Draw 1 card, discard 1`.

6. **Risk / sacrifice**
   - Gain progress at a cost.
   - Example: `+5 Force; lose 1 VITAE if the round fails`.

7. **Failure mitigation**
   - Reduce or cancel consequences of failure.
   - Example: `If this round fails, ignore 1 damage`.

8. **Synergy / combo**
   - Reward previous plays, matching colors, tags, or board state.
   - Example: `+1 for each card already played this round`.

9. **X-die interaction**
   - Enable specific uses of otherwise-blocked X dice.
   - Without one of these cards, X dice cannot be spent or used.
   - Example top: `Reroll 1 X die.`
   - Example bottom: `Spend purple: reroll all X dice, then create 1 mana of your choice.`

10. **Persistent enchantments**
    - Effects that remain between rounds.
    - Example bottom: `Enchant. Between rounds, refresh 1 spent die of your choice.`

## Persistent Effects / Enchantments

Persistent cards are allowed and desirable.

They create a Mage Knight-like rhythm:

- Round 1: establish tools.
- Round 2: exploit or recover dice.
- Final round: cash in the board, spend the debt, or survive the punishment.

Potential persistent effects:

- Refresh one spent die between rounds.
- Preserve one die into the next round.
- Refresh one die of a specific color.
- Enable one X die per round to be treated as a chosen color.
- Reduce final-round difficulty.
- Add +1 to a specific progress type each round.

ENCHANT cards are removed from the draw deck when played and occupy a separate enchantment zone. They are not reshuffled into the discard.

## Outcome Scoring

Each round produces `O` or `X`.

Final score:

```text
score = count(O) - count(X)
```

Suggested 3-round reward ladder:

- `3 O / 0 X` → strong reward
- `2 O / 1 X` → normal reward
- `1 O / 2 X` → survive, minor/no reward, possible minor penalty
- `0 O / 3 X` → bad outcome, damage, or lost opportunity

For 4–5 round hazards, use the same principle but tune thresholds per hazard severity.

## Player Experience & Design Tensions

Round one is reconnaissance. The player looks at four dice and five cards and begins asking what kind of hand they were dealt. There is a feeling worth having here — not helplessness, not mastery, but *negotiation*. The dice say what is available. The cards say what might be done with that.

By round two, the mana economy shows its shape. An enchantment played in round one starts returning. A bad roll — three X and a red — becomes an interesting problem rather than a foregone conclusion. X-interaction cards are where clever play starts feeling like discovery rather than subtraction.

Round three is debt collection. Everything the player conserved or spent carelessly in the first two rounds comes to judgment.

The top-bottom route choice functions as the session's first commitment. The player who chooses the bottom route and fails has no one to blame but their own ambition.

**Where it breaks:**

**The dice run dry.** Without refresh cards, by round three there may be zero available mana. This is the intended pressure — but if the final round is simultaneously harder, the player can reach an unwinnable state through misfortune rather than mismanagement. Watch the top route carefully; top-route final rounds must be completable on top-action progress alone, with no mana. If any top-route final round requires mana to clear, its threshold is too high.

**Tag proliferation bleeds legibility.** More than four progress types in v0 turns rounds into bookkeeping. Four types only: Stability, Escape, Supply, Force. No more until the system proves readable.

**Homogeneous hands.** A player drawing four direct progress cards plays the same round every time: add numbers, check threshold. Enchantment and X-interaction cards break this flatness, but they must show up. Watch deck ratios. If flat rounds appear twice in a session, the direct progress share is too high.

**Bottom route as tax, not temptation.** If the reward delta between top and bottom routes is not genuinely meaningful — not just larger numbers but things the player *wants* — the choice collapses into a difficulty toggle. Rewards on the bottom route must be worth the risk, or the design is lying to the player.

## Comparable Systems

**Mage Knight** is the explicit model. Siege puzzles, top/bottom card actions, mana dice, persistent effects built in early rounds to cash in late. The planning *before* the action is the game.

**Arkham Horror: The Card Game** for the chaos bag's relationship to bad outcomes. X dice should carry some of that character: not pure RNG inconvenience, but a sense that the world is antagonistic. X-interaction cards give the player a relationship with bad fate rather than a passive receipt of it.

**Gloomhaven** for exhaustion as a meaningful resource. Burning good cards early to build position vs. conserving for later. A player who spends mana carelessly in round one should feel it in round three.

**Spirit Island** for constraint-puzzle solving. A good hazard round should feel like assembling a precise combination under pressure — not "did I reach the number" but "did I find the line."

**Slay the Spire** for deck composition as identity. The deck-building dimension means that even within the hazard's three rounds, certain card combinations reward recognition. The player should occasionally feel that they *built something* — over both the hazard and the campaign — not just played cards.

## Card Deck & Rarity System

The action card pool is not a flat 30-card hazard deck. Cards are unlocked through hazard rewards and exploration. The player builds and refines their deck as the campaign progresses.

### Rarity Tiers

- **Common:** Bread-and-butter cards. Players start with multiple copies of these. Staples include draw cards, basic progress cards, and Focus buff cards.
- **Uncommon:** Stronger or more situational effects. Earned through hazard completion and exploration.
- **Rare:** Powerful, often game-altering effects. Enchantments and X-to-O converters sit here.

### Starter Deck

The starting deck is built primarily from Common cards, with multiple copies of:
- Draw / card filtering cards
- Basic single-type progress cards
- Focus buff cards

### Dev Mode

A dev menu must exist that allows adding any card directly to the active hand. This is required for efficient prototyping and tuning of individual cards before full deck-building balance is established.

### Card Lifecycle

- At hazard start: shuffle the player's personal deck.
- Each round: draw 5 cards from the deck.
- Played cards go to a shared hazard discard pile.
- If the deck empties mid-round, shuffle the discard and continue.
- ENCHANT cards are placed in the enchantment zone and do not return to the discard or deck.

## First Prototype Scope

Recommended v0 content set:

- 30 action cards across Common / Uncommon / Rare tiers (see section below)
- 15 hazard cards
- 3 rounds by default; 4–5 round variants for select hazards
- 4 mana dice
- 5-card hand per round
- Top/bottom hazard route, chosen after card draw and before dice roll
- Success / failure marks
- Final score / reward table
- Dev mode hand-injection for rapid card testing

## Design Decisions

The following questions were raised during v0 design and resolved.

**Q1 — Dice lifecycle.**
Roll all four dice once, after route choice and before round 1. They persist as board objects for the entire hazard. No automatic refresh between rounds. By round three, a player without refresh effects may have zero available mana. Cards and enchantments are the only mechanisms for extending, transforming, or recovering that luck.

**Q2 — Action card lifecycle.**
Players draw from their personal deck — the 30 cards represent the full content pool, not a flat per-hazard deck. Shuffle the personal deck at hazard start. Draw 5 each round. Played cards go to the hazard discard. If the deck empties, shuffle the discard and continue. ENCHANT cards occupy the enchantment zone and are not reshuffled. Draw and filtering effects are meaningful because the deck is finite and has history.

**Q3 — Progress types in v0.**
Four types only: **Stability, Escape, Supply, Force.** Focus is not a hazard progress type — it is a card buff mechanic that amplifies other progress cards. Dual-type requirements (e.g., 5 Stability + 4 Force in one round) are permitted on bottom routes and final rounds.

**Q4 — Bottom route timing.**
The player chooses top or bottom after drawing their opening hand but before the dice are rolled. They know their cards; they do not yet know their mana. This preserves the identity commitment of the choice while giving the player one layer of tactical information.

## Test Protocol

Prototype scope: all 30 action cards, 10 hazard cards (before adding the 5 longer hazards), 3-round default, 4 mana dice, 5-card hand.

**Session 1.** Play top route on all hazards. Measure: how often does a competent player clear all three rounds? Target 70–80% success. Higher — raise thresholds. Lower — reduce.

**Session 2.** Play bottom route on all hazards. Target 40–60% success. If the choice never creates tension, the reward delta is too small or the threshold is too low.

**Session 3.** Mix routes. Measure: does mana exhaustion produce a genuine crisis in round three? Does the final round feel different from rounds one and two, or are all rounds identical?

**Session 4.** Stress-test X dice. Force at least two X dice in the starting roll. Measure: do X-interaction cards change the calculus? Does exploiting X feel like cleverness or merely reduced misfortune?

Watch for flat rounds — a player who plays numbers without assembling solutions. If it happens twice in a session, the direct progress ratio is too high and the deck needs rebalancing.

## Action Cards (30)

Each card has a **top action** (free) and a **bottom action** (costs mana; stronger, stranger, or more tactical). Spending mana marks an available die as spent. Temporary dice expire at end of round unless a card says otherwise. ENCHANT cards are removed from the draw deck when played and occupy the enchantment zone until the hazard ends.

## Balance Notes for First Prototype

### Dice Economy

Starting roll of 4 dice: expected ~0.7 X dice (1-in-6 per die). Expected colored available dice: ~3.3.

Without any refresh effects, and assuming 2 dice spent per round, the player enters round 3 with zero available mana. This is the intended cliff — but it means The Watcher's Lamp and Iron Discipline are not convenience cards; they are survival cards. If neither appears, the top route must remain completable on top-action progress alone (no mana required). Verify this in Session 1.

### Threshold Calibration

5-card hand baseline (top actions only, no mana spending):

- Expected ~2 direct progress cards drawn per round: avg +2–3 each = +4–6 raw progress
- Focus buff cards stacking on a progress card: +2–3 additional
- Other incidental contributions: +0–1
- Reliable floor without mana: ~5–7 progress per round

With 1 mana-enabled bottom action: +5 additional = ~10–12 per round
With 2 bottom actions: ~14–16 per round (requires 2 available dice)

This validates the threshold targets:
- Top routes at 5–7 per round: clearable on top actions alone — correct
- Bottom routes at 8–11 per round: require at least 1 mana-enabled bottom action — correct
- Final round +2 to +3: requires at least 1 available die entering the final round — this is the design

### X-Die Interaction Rate

Three X-interaction cards in 30: ~43% probability of at least one appearing in a 5-card draw. Against 2+ X dice showing, this rate may feel too low to deliver the recovery fantasy. Two options:

**(a)** Increase X-interaction cards from 3 to 5 (cut 2 direct progress cards from 6 to 4).

**(b)** Add a hazard rule: *If 2 or more dice show X at the start of a round, the player may look at the top 2 cards of the action deck and add 1 to their hand before drawing their 5.*

Option (b) is cleaner in v0 — it targets the specific failure condition without changing deck ratios.

### Synergy / Combo Floor

Pattern Lock (card 23) has a minimum of +2 Stability — adequate floor. Without it, the card would be unplayable in ~30% of board states.

Momentum: floor of +2 on bottom — adequate.
Chain Work: +3 when played first — adequate.

### Persistent Map Benefits — Future Phase

H08, H12, and H15 include persistent map benefits that modify future hazards or block map routes. These require world-state tracking that does not exist yet. They are marked with ⚑ in the hazard descriptions. Until the world-state system ships, these rewards should either be skipped or replaced with equivalent one-time item/VITAE grants.

See `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md` — a high-priority candidate for hazard world-state tracking has been filed.

### First Prototype Session Sequence

Session 1 and 2 (top and bottom route baselines):
H01, H02, H04, H05, H06, H07, H10, H12, H13, H15 — covers solo-type and dual-type requirements, 3-round and 4-round structures, VITAE consequences, and persistent map benefits.

Session 3 (stress test):
Add H03, H09, H11, H14 — 4-round and 5-round structures, compounding dual-type requirements.

Do not prototype all 15 at once. Tune the first ten before the longer hazards prove whether the mana economy holds over five rounds.
