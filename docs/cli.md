# CLI

> Command-line interface for interacting with the Axiomancer mechanics engine.

## Overview

The CLI module provides a complete command-line interface for playing and testing the game. It includes a full interactive game driver, development tools, and flexible I/O abstractions.

## Components

### `game.cli.ts` - Main Game Interface

The primary CLI driver that provides a tabbed inquirer interface for playing the game. The main menu tabs are:

- **Map** - Travel between nodes and resolve node events on the current map
- **Travel** - Cross to another map on the current continent (e.g. `fishing-village` ↔ `northern-forest`) via `store.travelToMap`, so the whole continent and every map-event kind are reachable
- **Journal** - View active/completed quests and philosophical alignment
- **Skills** - View known/unlocked skills
- **Codex** - Unlocked journal entries from befriended foes
- **Inventory** - Items carried in the pack
- **Character** - Full stats, equipment, and effects sheet
- **DEV** - Manipulate character, grant items/skills, spawn enemies
- **Begin again** - Reset to the starting hearth (full reset, or keep-character)
- **Save** - Write the current state to the save file
- **Load** - Restore state from the save file
- **Quit**

There is **no combat tab** — a Map `encounter` node only *stages* combat and prints
an instruction to run the Hazard-Pattern combat CLI (`npm run combat`).

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run game
```

**Features:**
- Full game loop interaction through store actions
- Cross-map travel across the current continent
- Save/load functionality
- Development cheats and debugging

### `combat.cli.ts` - New Hazard-style Combat CLI (Phase 165)

A standalone driver for the **Spec 25/26b Hazard-style combat engine**, reachable as a subcommand of the game CLI. Drives the card-and-dice HP-model combat (the primary system — status effects are the efficient path, raw strikes are the weak baseline). Supports interactive TTY play, `--auto` bot policies, and scripted/stdin agentic modes.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run game -- combat [flags]
npm run combat -- [flags]             # convenience alias
```

**Combat routing:**

| Command | Engine |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run combat` | Hazard-style card/dice engine (`combat.cli.ts`) |
| `npm run combat-sim` | Monte-Carlo balance witness (not player-facing) |

**Combat flags:**

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--enemy <slug>` | Enemy from the registry (default `mournful-gull`). |
| `--preset <id>` | Character preset id (default `apprentice`). |
| `--seed <n>` | Deterministic RNG seed — same seed → same dice, same outcome. |
| `--auto` | Run a bot policy without TTY (no prompts). |
| `--policy naive\|safe\|aggressive\|status` | Bot policy for `--auto` (default `status`). `status` prioritises landing new distinct status effects (DoT/control) for the combo-refresh loop. |
| `--max-turns <n>` | Stop auto play after N threat phases (default `8`). |
| `--script <path>` | JSON answer array (shared `io.ts` layer). |
| `--stdin` | Line-buffered JSONL answers (shared `io.ts` layer). |
| `--json-events` | Machine-clean event stream on stdout. |
| `--state-log <path>` | JSONL state mutation log (start / phase / end records). |

**Examples:**
```bash
# Deterministic auto run (status-focused bot, reproducible)
npm run combat -- --auto --policy status --enemy mournful-gull --seed 42 \
  --max-turns 12 --json-events --state-log /tmp/combat.jsonl

# Interactive TTY play
npm run combat -- --enemy wet-hound --preset wanderer
```

**State-log records** (for agentic consumers):
- `hazardCombat:start` — encounter initialised (player + enemy + policy)
- `hazardCombat:autoPhase` — one full auto-played threat phase
- `hazardCombat:draft` — die drafted (interactive)
- `hazardCombat:playCard` — card played (interactive)
- `hazardCombat:resolveThreat` — threat phase resolved + between-phases
- `hazardCombat:mercy` — mercy choice made
- `hazardCombat:signature` — signature skill cast
- `hazardCombat:end` — encounter over; `event.outcome` ∈ `{victory, mercy, defeat, retreat}`

### `combat-sim.cli.ts` - Hazard-Pattern Combat Balance Sim

A non-interactive Monte-Carlo witness that runs `simulateHazardPatternCombat`
against a curated set of enemies across difficulty tiers and prints win-rate,
outcome distribution, round count, and status-engagement stats. Used for
balance tuning — not player-facing.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run combat-sim
npm run combat-sim -- --blind
npm run combat-sim -- --enemy=CoastalTyrant
npm run combat-sim -- --loadout=slippery-slope,eternal-regress,befriend
npm run combat-sim -- --runs=300 --seed=1 --blind
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--blind` | Realistic-player witness: the bot drafts using only information a real player can see (no hidden-stance peek). Use to gauge the difficulty a real player feels. Default is `--greedy` (omniscient bot, the balance ceiling). |
| `--enemy <Name>` | Run against one enemy only (e.g. `CoastalTyrant`, `HushWraith`). Omit to run the full tier sweep. |
| `--loadout <ids>` | Comma-separated skill IDs for the player's deck (default `slippery-slope`). |
| `--runs <n>` | Number of Monte-Carlo playthroughs (default `200`). |
| `--seed <n>` | Deterministic RNG seed for reproducible runs (default `1`). |

**Output:** Win-rate percentage, round count, status-effect hit distribution, and per-enemy breakdown printed to stdout.

### `hazard.cli.ts` - Hazard Mini-Game Driver

A standalone driver for the hazard mini-game, reachable as a **subcommand** of
the game CLI. It reuses the same `io.ts` layer (tty / `--script` / `--stdin`,
plus `--json-events` and `--state-log`) so a person, a replay file, or an agent
can all drive it the same way.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run game -- hazard [flags]
npm run hazard -- [flags]            # convenience alias
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--hazard <id>` | Pick a hazard card (e.g. `H01`). Prompts from the library when omitted. |
| `--route top\|bottom` | Choose the route. Prompts when omitted. |
| `--auto` | A greedy heuristic plays each round (focus first, then matching progress cards, preferring affordable bottom actions). Otherwise the player picks cards by hand. |
| `--seed <n\|str>` | Seed the shared RNG so dice rolls and the deck shuffle are reproducible. |
| `--runs <n>` | Play N hazards back-to-back (default **5**). |
| `--script <path>` | Scripted answers (JSON array), as in `game.cli.ts`. |
| `--stdin` | Line-buffered stdin answers. |
| `--json-events` | Emit `hazard:complete` / `hazard:summary` events as JSON on stdout. |
| `--state-log <path>` | Append a per-decision JSONL trace (init, route, dice, each round, final score). |

**Encounter vs. player state.** Each run creates a fresh per-encounter *hazard
state* (the engine's `HazardMinigameState`); dice exhaustion / refresh and deck
state persist **within** that encounter and are discarded when it ends. A
cross-run *player ledger* (vitae / supply / items / threatened-X) persists
across `--runs` and is only reset when the process exits.

> Reward/penalty application is a CLI-layer policy (the engine's `resolveRound`
> does not yet apply them): each `X` round applies the route `failurePenalty`
> (plus `finalRoundFailurePenalty` on the last round), and the route `reward` is
> granted when the encounter nets positive.

**Illegal actions** (unaffordable bottom cost, unknown card, wrong phase) are
**warned and skipped** rather than aborting the run — and logged to the state
log as an `illegalHazardAction` record carrying the attempted action and a full
hazard-state snapshot, so automated tuning can learn from them.

**Examples:**
```bash
# Reproducible auto run of one hazard, machine-readable trace
npm run hazard -- --auto --seed 42 --runs 1 --hazard H01 --route top \
  --json-events --state-log /tmp/hazard.jsonl

# Interactive manual play, prompted for hazard + route
npm run hazard -- --runs 1
```

### `gathering.cli.ts` - Gathering Mini-Game Driver

A standalone driver for the gathering mini-game ("The Gleaning"), reachable as a
**subcommand** of the game CLI. Like `hazard.cli.ts` it reuses the same `io.ts`
layer (tty / `--script` / `--stdin`, plus `--json-events` and `--state-log`).

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run game -- gathering [flags]
npm run gathering -- [flags]         # convenience alias
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--site <id>` | Pick a gathering site (e.g. `mire-mint`). Prompts from the library when omitted. |
| `--approach glean\|strip` | The binding stance. Prompts when omitted. |
| `--auto` | A restrained push-your-luck heuristic (the balance sim's "balanced" bot) plays the site. Otherwise the player drives by hand. |
| `--seed <n\|str>` | Seed the engine's embedded RNG so a run is fully reproducible. |
| `--runs <n>` | Play N sites back-to-back (default **5**). |
| `--script <path>` | Scripted answers (JSON array), as in `game.cli.ts`. |
| `--stdin` | Line-buffered stdin answers. |
| `--json-events` | Emit completion/summary events as JSON on stdout. |
| `--state-log <path>` | Append a per-decision JSONL trace; illegal actions are logged as `illegalGatheringAction` with a full state snapshot. |

### `rest.cli.ts` - Rest Mini-Game Driver

A standalone driver for the rest mini-game ("The Night Watch"), reachable as a
**subcommand** of the game CLI. It reuses the same `io.ts` layer as the other
play-loop CLIs.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run game -- rest [flags]
npm run rest -- [flags]              # convenience alias
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--posture deep\|doze\|watch` | The night's posture. Prompts when omitted. |
| `--auto` | The balance sim's policy plays the night (the posture picks the bot: `deep` → deep-sleeper, `watch` → watcher, `doze` → fire-tender). |
| `--base-heal <f>` | The authored map-event baseline heal fraction (default **1.0**) scaling the whole night. |
| `--seed <n\|str>` | Seed the engine's embedded RNG so a run is fully reproducible. |
| `--runs <n>` | Play N nights back-to-back (default **5**). |
| `--script <path>` | Scripted answers (JSON array), as in `game.cli.ts`. |
| `--stdin` | Line-buffered stdin answers. |
| `--json-events` | Emit `rest:complete` / `rest:summary` events as JSON on stdout. |
| `--state-log <path>` | Append a per-decision JSONL trace; illegal actions are logged as `illegalRestAction` with a full state snapshot. |

### `lootcache.cli.ts` - Loot Cache Mini-Game Driver

A standalone driver for the loot-cache push-your-luck mini-game ("The
Reliquary"), reachable as a **subcommand** of the game CLI.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run game -- loot-cache [flags]
npm run loot-cache -- [flags]        # convenience alias
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--policy greedy\|prudent\|prober` | The bot for `--auto` (default `prober`), reusing the `lootcache.sim.ts` push-your-luck `decide()` logic. |
| `--auto` | The policy plays each cache. Otherwise the player decides whether to push or bank by hand. |
| `--currency <n>` | The starting currency stake (default the engine's `DEFAULT_CACHE_CURRENCY`). |
| `--seed <n\|str>` | Seed the engine's embedded RNG so a run is fully reproducible. |
| `--runs <n>` | Play N caches back-to-back (default **5**). |
| `--script <path>` | Scripted answers (JSON array), as in `game.cli.ts`. |
| `--stdin` | Line-buffered stdin answers. |
| `--json-events` | Emit completion/summary events as JSON on stdout. |
| `--state-log <path>` | Append a per-decision JSONL trace; illegal actions are logged as `illegalLootCacheAction` with a full state snapshot. |

### `quest-board.cli.ts` - Quest Board Mini-Game Driver

A standalone driver for the quest-board mini-game ("The Boy's Almanac"),
reachable as a **subcommand** of the game CLI. The quest cannot be failed — it
resolves to a cosmetic outcome tier.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run game -- quest-board [flags]
npm run quest-board -- [flags]       # convenience alias
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--policy safe\|gambler\|economist` | The bot for `--auto` (default `economist`), reusing the `quest-board.sim.ts` per-policy option shapes. |
| `--auto` | The policy plays the whole board to a claimed outcome. Otherwise the player drives each open space by hand. |
| `--board <id>` | The board to play (default `build-the-boat`). Validated against `QUEST_BOARDS`. |
| `--seed <n\|str>` | Seed the engine's embedded RNG so a run is fully reproducible. |
| `--runs <n>` | Play N boards back-to-back (default **3**). |
| `--script <path>` | Scripted answers (JSON array), as in `game.cli.ts`. |
| `--stdin` | Line-buffered stdin answers. |
| `--json-events` | Emit completion/summary events as JSON on stdout. |
| `--state-log <path>` | Append a per-decision JSONL trace; illegal actions are logged as `illegalQuestBoardAction` with a full state snapshot. |
