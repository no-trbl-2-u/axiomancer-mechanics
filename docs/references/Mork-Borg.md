The Wind from the west. From the

sundered land. Rot rides it, and the

stench of blood. Cursed walker, will

you travel there? To the Valley of the

Unfortunate Undead? Our young

ones are taken by the child-thief

Tergol, known for his vile crimes

and alchemy of flesh.

D istAnces shift. pAths between plAces wArp. As if this
pale, lightless world possessed a will and bitter life. Its mercy
curdled to wrath over a too-long age. Who are you? The grave
robber with silver glittering between cracked fingernails?
The mystic who would bend the world’s miserable heart away
from its inevitable end?

Most likely, it makes little difference. No one has seen the
sun in years. The old care more for sacrifice and god-offerings
than their bawling spawn. Doomsayers are proved right time
and again and embraced by hidden powers. Maybe it’s best to
surrender—to trust your own instinct and skill rather than the
whim of the dice? Before all is drowned in welcome silence.
Life locked and failing in a **DARK FORT.**


# What Was Written

# Must Be Known

**I**

A nuk schleger, monk of the Creton order, encountered the
basilisk Verhu in the year 565 and set down that creature’s
whispered prophecies. These lost texts came to be known as
the Nameless Scriptures.

300 years later, while working on a new Cathedral, The Two-
Headed Basilisks, an orthodox branch of the Creton order
uncovered Schlegers tomb and with it the Scriptures.

Since then all events described within have come to pass.
The prophecies are absolutely, factually true and have, thus,
supplanted all other Scripture. Around this cathedral has
grown Galgenbeck, the greatest city that ever was.

**II**

The bAsilisks Are two And two-heAded. The four heads
have argued for hundreds of years. Verhu predicts inexorable
annihilation and, since he’s always right, has become utterly
full of himself.

His is also the head worshipped most. If you could learn the
codes of the apocalypse perhaps the right offerings might avert
it? Verhu loves his position and hungers for temples to be raised
in his name.


**III**

When the world was but water, dust and clouds thick with
plague-fat flies came she, first of the basilisks. From the cracks
of Bergen Chrypt she crawled. she bears the head of Denial,
Lusi, who looks up and down. Yet all shall be well. Her twin Arkh,
Head of Deception, claims to be the first prophet of truths now
prostituted by Verhu. Few have ever seen her, the oldest, but
many walk her twin paths.

she spawned many since the dawn of time, their conceptions not
without agony. All were cast down the cliffs of Bergen Chrypt,
only he survived. Down in the Valley of the Unfortunate Undead
his eyes locked upon the mountain’s peak, he spits out curses
upon his evil mother. The head Gorgh is bitter, rank with envy
that only his twin Verhu knows the damned truth. Time and time
again his prophecies are brought to be. The piles of gold-gift
riches from his faithful teeter and slide, so tall are they.

**IV**

The world dies even now. Reality decays, truth becomes
dream and dream, truth. Cracks grow in the once-stable
structures of the past, allowing things misshapen and vile to
worm through, emerging into day’s wan light. The world closes
in, bounded to the west by the massive Bergen Chrypt with its
catacombs and ice-caked peaks east. Many have ploughed the
wave’s furrow in search of and surrounded by the Endless Sea
to the north, south and known new lands. They all return, against
their will. Alive or dead.


# Galgenbeck

GAlgenbeck in the lAnd of tvelAnd is the greatest city
that ever was. No King or Queen rules in Galgenbeck but an
arch-priestess: Josilfa Migol. Deep beneath the Cathedral of the
Two-Headed Basilisks, in a cool black chamber crossed by shards
of light, lies her throne. Josilfa, old but still young, commoners
gossip that she colludes with the god Nechrubel, who gave her
eternal life. Nechrubel: the shadow that covers all. Nechrubel is
melancholy, crop failure, conflict and war. It is said he whispered
the apocalyptic prophecies in Verhu’s ear.

As time grows ever shorter the Two-Headed Basilisks become
ever-more desperate in their recruitment. To take one’s own life
is considered sinful cowardice. The road to salvation lies through
mortification of the flesh; the apocalypse is to be met with eyes
wide open. Only then can the soul be allowed passage to the
Shimmering Fields. Heretics and apostates are hunted down and
corrected, in public and at length, by the Inquisition.

In Tveland also lies

# Sarkash

The forest seems, lately, to spread unnaturally fast. Paths
tangle and wind in the overgrown gloom, leading wanderers
astray. Far in the depths of Sarkash, always where one least
expects to find it, in a halo of dying trees, is Graven-Tosk. A truly
ancient cemetery filled with mausoleums, blank-eyed cherubs,
stagnant fountains, plague pits and ordinary graves.

But hasn’t it grown warmer in this usually cold place? Do you
hear the frantic scratching? The air feels heavy, stale and hard to
breathe.


Rising over Graven-Tosk like rage rising over pain is the

# Palace of the Shadow King

A gothic blAck cAstle, like a mirror to the Cathedral of the
Two-Headed Basilisk in Galgenbeck. Most of the palace lies in
crumbling ruins, home to unfortunate souls sheltering beneath
its broken halls. None dare dream what might lie under the
rubble covered catacombs and cellars. Tunnels sprawl beneath
like writhing roots, digging deeper into the cold earth like
cancerous veins. The inner wing still stands, acting as the home
of the Shadow King, a being obscured by ritual. The slaves of the
servants of the courtiers of the King come forth and do his will.

The title is hereditary: sons are always born to the Shadow King.
It’s whispered Princes of that line disguise themselves as ordinary
men wandering the ruins engaging in games and tricking
travelers, multiplying the miseries of their people.


# Grift

From Ages pAst, Grift grew upon an eastern peninsula of the
Endless Sea. Cut from the world by the bottomless Múr, the
thriving city state can be reached only by three bridges of such
might and cyclopean size it is said that only enslaved giants could
have raised them. Grift was once a place of harmony and the light
of reason, a shelter from the plaguewracked, war-torn world
beyond.

But the world turns and even the Múr cannot protect Grift from
its inevitable fall.

King Sigfúm the Kind is mocked in the street. Much of Grift has
fallen into disrepair as vile creatures begin crawling from the
dried, cracked earth. Each night the bridges scream and roar like
great ships grinding upon rocks. Sigfúm is defeated. He knows the
end is near, believes the prophecies of Verhu and so, kindly and
calmly, prepares his people for death. Huge parchments dot the
streets, calendars of despair marking each correct preparation
and its time. Each day a leaf is turned and when the last page
comes, Sigfúm will march his people to the cliff Terion to fulfill
what was written. Terion, a thousand meters of vertical rock with
the raging sea biting at its base.

The inquisition of the Two-Headed Basilisks is not too keen on
the heretical suicide scheme of Sigfúm the Kind.


# Kergüs

DesolAtion rolls over kergüs like a frostbarren wind. The
lawless and forlorn trek across its ice-wracked expanse, crawling
over the plains or cowering in the cracked earth to flee Blood-
Countess Anthelia. North, where the wind is born, lies Alliáns, a
storm-piercing spire-city of black glass. Within stands a castle
like a waterfall of white stone: the throne of Anthelia. She as pale
as her castle’s walls, as youthful as a drop of melting ice. Some
say she is eternally young. The gulls cry the names of Knights who
sought her hand, a reminder that suitors and signs of Anthelia’s
age disappear in conjunction. But who listens to a gull? And in
Kergüs, even gulls freeze in the cold that rolls from the dreams of
the Countess. Dreams of her unending youth.

**Anthelia’s Ambivalence**

Anthelia is well aware time is short. Neuroses burden her. _“Why
is everything so pale? So cold?”_ She cries out for colour or warmth.
She drains the world of both with every glance, touch and breath.
Those who bring her vibrant life are promised great rewards. All
fear to do so. Excuses are made, explanations found. The feelings
of the Countess are fragile, her powers absolute. Court life entails
grey opulence, excitement and fear.

# The Western Kingdom

The western kingdom, called Wästland in the songs of the
simple and rhymes of the poor, once home to peace and wealth
when Lake Onda gifted fish and the river-trade thrived.

Now, terror and despotism stalk. In the secret citadel of the
sad-but-gaudy city of Schleswig King Fathmu IX schemes.


Paranoid, fat and increasingly mad, he is consumed with
psychosis and invisible fears.

Obsessed with the prophecies of Verhu, the King raids and
invades houses and villages, barns and temples. Nowhere and no
one is safe, especially the poor. Taxed into starvation, the contents
of their larders and storehouses are carted off by Fathmu’s men.

A place few wish to speak of is the

# Valley of the

# Unfortunate Undead

Rumors whisper the bAsilisk _HE_ is coiled within its crypts,
a sight infrequently survived. Lies and legends enshroud the
valley, obscuring any truth. Peddler’s tales say the soil, the very
air, is lethal—bringing a sleepless, stumbling deat h. This is no
clean fate but a slow-growing, fathomless despair, weighing down
the traveler with poisoned memories and dark thoughts until the
spark of life is mutated into a mournful, hopeless undeath.

Others claim lost wanderers can fall and find themselves in the
Realm of the Dead when the black soil hungrily drags them under
the earth.

Those without hope travel here seeking an end to pain, a golden
afterlife beyond this dark and ruined world. They gather in
suicide cults and the valley’s few twisted trees begin to droop
strange fruit from hempen rope. Others plumb the crypts seeking
Verhu, believing they can persuade him of other fates. Some
simply and stupidly leave gifts and sacrifices to a power they
cannot comprehend. Gloom grows, obscuring the world like an
oil-stained image.


# The Calendar of Nechrubel

The world trembles. One can feel it in ways sharp and
subtle, mysterious and clear. One by one, inevitable events
demand their place.

Illustrating this, the Game Master (gm) rolls a die each dawn.
A result of 1 activates one Misery. The die used is determined
by the gm and the group.

The gm then rolls d66 to determine which Misery occurs.
The same Misery will not befall the world twice.

**7:**

The seventh Misery will always be 7:7, and the world finally
dies. The seventh seal is broken for the seventh and final time.
The game and your lives end here.

Burn the book.

**The Calendar of Nechrubel**

**- The Nameless Scriptures.**
    _Transcribed by Anuk Schleger the monk._

**PSALM I**

1:1 The City shall be made hollow. Of those who rest in
hollowness, they shall not be seen.
1:2 And the earth shall shake and be riven. And from the cracks
shall rise a poisonous mist, and in ten days it will shroud the
world.
1:3 Of those who build mightily, stone by stone, so shall they
fall, stone by stone.
1:4 And the depths of the underworld shall bring forth flying
spectres and crawling beasts. In their passing the worm grows fat,
the vulture weary.
1:5 Doubt is crowned. The loyal shall turn their blades on those
who silver gave.
1:6 And blood-cough shall spread like fire across the
wastelands of the drought.

**PSALM II**

2:1 As at the beginning, so at the end, all manner of fly and wasp
shall fill the air.
2:2 And the ground pale with maggots.
2:3 And from the Spears: a frost. Born from Bergen Chrypt and
covering all.
2:4 And in ten days and one the writings of sorcerers will be
made pale as air.
2:5 And glass shall become quartz.
2:6 And SHE shall see HIM grow stronger. And SHE reveals
herself and all shall be slain.


**PSALM III**

3:1 At Graven-Tosk the soil shall grow warm and those who rest
be made to walk.
3:2 In the heart of Sarkash fog and dusk shall breathe beneath
the waking trees. That which was hewed by man shall now hew in
its turn.
3:3 And hunger shall come among you. You shall dig roots
and pull children from the breast. The gaunt shall prey upon the
gaunt.
3:4 The great shall be made poor and the poor poorer still.
3:5 Then shall come rain unending and the day shall be made
night by its coming.
3:6 Brother shall slay Brother and Sister poison Sister.

**PSALM IV**

4:1 For five days and five nights mothers flesh shall be the cloak of
demons.
4:2 And for five days and five nights shall fathers weep.
4:3 Look to the West. Forth comes fire, and a horde, and the
Kingdoms burn.
4:4 The liar, Arkh shall make knots of the hearts of men,
sundering the strongest of bonds.
4:5 Behold now the Endless Sea, where Leviathan causes
waves to be as mountains.
4:6 And Leviathan shall come among you. Children winter-
born and fated to fall before snow, both shall it take.


**PSALM V**

5:1 The lake and brook shall blacken and the water become tar.
5:2 The trees shall wither, shrivel and die.
5:3 And birds shall fall dead from the sky.
5:4 In one night all those not yet of seven years and seven days
shall pass. Born and unborn. And dawn shall give them life as
eaters of men.
5:5 The sky shall weep fire and a great stone shall plummet as a
city fallen from heaven. Its gift is Death and madness is its herald.
5:6 And the last King and the last Queen shall wither to dust.
Their wretched courts are devoured by wolves.

**PSALM VI**

6:1 You shall know the last day is come. The sun shall set and
never rise.
6:2 And day shall be as night and night as day. You shall not
sleep, neither shall you wake.
6:3 Anthelia shall have her will and drink all colour from the
world.
6:4 Those who walk on two legs shall be nameless as the beasts
of the field.
6:5 The earth shall vein, bringing black serpents forth from
within the earth.
6:6 And the unnamed enter the earth, passing through the Veil
as it is sundered by Daejmon, the left underling of Nechrubel.

**PSALM VII THE LAST**

7:7 All praise Yetsabu-Nech, the underworld’s nightmare, the
black disk which stands before the sun! All praise Verhu, beaming
with delight! All praise the fire which burns all! And the darkness
shall swallow the darkness.

# Abilities

Agility Defend, balance, swim, flee
presence Perceive, aim, charm, wield Powers
strength Crush, lift, strike, grapple
toughness Resist poison/cold/heat, survive falling

Roll 3d6 And using the tAble on the right to generate each
ability score from −3 to +3. The sum is not used in the game once
the character is created, only the table value.

Player Characters not created with the optional classes can roll
4d6 and drop the lowest die for two of their abilities. When the
character is later improved an ability can never exceed +6 or −3.

**aBilities**
1–4 –3
5–6 –2
7–8 –1
9–12 ±0
13–14 +1
15–1 6 +2
17–20 +3


# Tests

Tests Are mAde AgAinst A difficulty rAting. To succeed
roll d20 ±your ability with a result equal to or greater than
the dr. Creatures don’t use abilities, they just roll a d20 against
dr. For example, find bear trap dr14 or resist red poison dr12.

**diFFiculty ratiNgs (dr)**
6 so simple people laugh at you for failing
8 routine but some chance of failure
10 pretty simple but not simple enough to not roll
12 normal
14 difficult
16 really hard
18 should not be possible

# Carrying Capacity

You cAn cArry strength+8 normal-sized items (for example
crowbars, lard, scrolls, torches but not anvils, chests, ladders,
corpses) without a problem. After that when testing Strength
and Agility dr increases by 2 (from 12 to 14 etc.). It is impossible
to carry more than twice Strength+8.


# Hit Points

Begin with toughness + d8. In worst case 1hp, but never less.
**Zero HP:** broken **Negative HP:** dead

**BrOKeN (d4)**
1 Fall unconscious for d4 rounds, awaken with d4 hp.
2 Roll a d6:1-5 = Broken or severed limb. 6 = Lost eye.
Can’t act for d4 rounds then become active with d4 hp.
3 Hemorrhage: death in d2 hours unless treated. All tests
are dr16 the first hour. dr18 the last hour.
4 Dead.


# Violence

**iNitiative (d6)**
1–3 enemies go first
4–6 pcs go first
_Agility + d6 for individual initiative or to determine who goes first within
the group._

Players roll for both their attacks and defences.
Creatures and enemies don’t roll dice in combat.

The dr for attacks and defence are modified as with any test.

**melee**
Test Strength dr1 2

**raNged**
Test Presence dr1 2

**deFeNce**
Test Agility dr1 2

If you fail the enemy hits you. Enemies attack once per round
unless noted otherwise.


**crit (Natural 20)**
Attack: Double damage, armor/protection is also reduced one tier.
Defence: pc gains a free attack.

**FumBle (Natural 1)**
Attack: The weapon breaks or is lost.
Defence: pc takes double damage and armor is reduced one tier.
When armor is damaged penalties to Strength and Agility
tests are not modified.
_Armor reduced below 1st tier is ruined and cannot be repaired.
For armor repair costs, see Equipment on page 24._

**How long is a round?**

A round is enough time to make an attack (or use a Power) and
traverse a normal-sized room. There are usually 10 rounds in one
minute.

# Rest

† Catch your breath, have a drink. Restore d4 hp.
† A full night’s sleep restores d6 hp.
† Without food or drink no hp is restored when resting
and after two days a starving pc loses d4 hp per day.
† An infected character does not benefit from resting.
Instead, d6 hp is lost daily.


# Reaction (2D6)

When meeting creAtures whose reaction is uncertain.

2–3 Kill!
4–6 Angered
7–8 Indifferent
9–10 Almost friendly
11–12 Helpful

# Morale

Most enemies will not fight to the last drop of blood.

**rOll FOr mOrale iF**
the leader is killed
half the group is eliminated
a single enemy has only 1/3 of its hp left

If you roll greater than the creature’s Morale value with 2d6,
it is demoralized. Roll d6 to see if the enemy (1–3) flees or
(4–6) surrenders.


# Getting Better

```
or worse
```
The gAme mAster decides when a character should be
improved. It can be after completing a scenario, killing mighty
foes or bringing home treasure.

When this happens the following things occur:

**More HP**

Roll 6d10. If the result is equal to or greater than your current
maximum hp, increase it by d6.

**Left in the debris you find**

**d6**
1–3 nothing
4 3d10 silver
5 an unclean scroll
6 a sacred scroll

**Ability changes**

Roll a d6 against every ability. Results equal to or greater than
the ability increase it by 1, to a maximum of +6. Results below
the ability decrease it by 1.

Abilities from −3 to +1 are always increased by 1 unless the d6
result is 1. The ability is then reduced by 1, but never below -3.


# Powers

A few so-cAlled powers are known and they are usually
found written in scrolls.

Roll Presence + d4 every morning to determine how many times
you can use Powers that day; choose from your available scrolls.
When reading a scroll, test Presence dr12. If you succeed, the
Power is activated and you subtract one use from your daily
total. If you fail, the Power doesn’t work, you lose d2 hp and you
become dizzy for the next hour. During this time, Powers will
always fail in the worst possible way.

The gm decides the effect on a Crit or Fumble, but on page 43 is
an optional table of arcane catastrophes.

**uNcleaN scrOlls d10**
1 pAlms open the southern gAte: A ball of fire hits
d2 creatures dealing d8 damage per creature.

Arcane Catastrophes

```
_Effects in italic are things the caster might not immediately realize._

A caster who rolls the same result twice explodes in screaming
black fire in which the faces of the dead are seen. D6 damage
each round.Water only feeds this fire.

**arcaNe catastrOPHes (d20)**
1 One by one your teeth fall out. Long, brittle fingernails
replace them in your gums. _Your smile is horrific and you find
it hard to eat._
2 You feel fine. It’s **fine**. _You pustulate with a magical STD. Those
intimate with you will die of plague within_ d4 _days then rise as
woeful weeping zombies who track you down in your dreams
before finding you in reality._
3 Your skeleton is possessed by some unearthly force and
will do anything to kill you and escape. Drowning or
piercing is preferred so the bones are not damaged. Test
Strength dr10 in stressful situations or take d4 damage.
_When you die, you become a zombie._
4 The illusion of the celestial sphere is lifted, you now see
what dwells beyond. And it sees you. Gazing upon a clear
night sky drives you mad with fear.
5 Around you falls an unending snow of black ash which
only you and the mad can perceive. _Water sickens you from
this day on. Only ash, soot or burnt remains can quench your thirst._
6 The earth decays around you like wet flesh. You sink
3 feet and cannot climb out without help. Clinging to you,
screaming and biting are d4 translucent, crayfish-like
children with your face.
**HP** 3 **Morale** - **No armor Bite/pinch** d4


**arcaNe catastrOPHes (d20) cONt.**
7 Your skin tatters like paper, your flesh melts like wax and
your intestines bloat like balloons, bursting and falling out
until all that is left is a walking, talking skeleton.
8 A gnashing gaptoothed mouth splits open on your neck.
It spits out your secrets and inner thoughts _and can be
silenced to sleep only with blood._
9 The sky warps and stars spin like wheels. Thrown one day
into the future, you arrive vomiting Time as evaporating
silver bile. _A Misery is fulfilled._
10 Light itself despises you. If you gaze upon a candle,
lamp or torch it goes out.
11 _Within_ d4 _days a vile cocoon heaves from the ground, soon
bursting and spawning your exact clone. It is unintelligent and
begins to spread mischief and suffering. This happens every couple
of days until the ground is cleansed with holy water or fire._
12 Your eyes burn with insufferable agony, bleeding
heavily before loosening and falling from their gory pits.
You continue to see through them wherever they are.
13 You and a random nearby creature pass out. _When you
wake up, your souls have switched. Welcome to your new flesh._
14 Five twisted, skeletal arms burst from your back. The
hands are mischievous, violent and terribly cruel.
15 Your skin pales then begins to emit a sickly greenish light.
_Living things held close to you slowly fall ill. They weaken, their
bones become brittle, their teeth and hair fall out._
16 The Power works, but fate or a demonic force perverts
its effects to your precise disadvantage.
17 The scroll crumbles to tendrils of fine black powder
which reach for your nose and mouth. Make a dr1 4
Toughness test or lose d10 hp.


**arcaNe catastrOPHes (d20) cONt.**
18 The Power pierces you like a knife, feeding on your
anima. You are permanently gaunt and drawn, insatiably
hungry. _When resting you restore only half of the rolled_ hp_._
19 You fall through Refva into the esoteric dimension of
Cube-Violet, a place of mythical obscurity. The walls are
smooth, iridescent and cold. Above, an endless inferno.
**To leave (d4):**

1. Slay riddling Kulvan (strong goblin, page 58)
    who holds three colorless pearls.
2. Poison a close friend with crumbled Sict-Shroom
    (Toughness dr16 or -d6 hp and hallucinations).
    They are found only within the cube.
3. Reach up through the fire to the golden key above.
    d4 fingers burn to ash.
4. The cube is perfect, and empty. You can only wait in
    maddening timeless silence until another fool arrives.
20 Perhaps it’s for the best. HE emerges from the shadows.
At least your suffering is short, almost instantaneous,
as the two-headed basilisk devours you.


# Optional Classes (D6)

**1. Fanged deserter**

You hAve thirty or so friends who never let you down:
YOUR TEETH. Disloyal, deranged or simply uncontrollable,
any group that didn’t boot you out you left anyway. But your
parliament of teeth—enormous, protruding, thick and sharp
—have always been your allies.

bite AttAck: dr10 to attack, d6 damage. You must be close
to your target. 1–2 on d6 chance the enemy gets a free attack.

Begins with 2d6 × 10s and d2 Omens. hp: Toughness + d10

**earliest memOries (d6)**
1 A burnt-black building in Sarkash. Your home?

someone to return.
5 Following an army in eastern Wästland.

**aBilities**

spArk, roll 3d6-1 for Agility and Presence. Normal Agility tests

1 crumpled monster mAsk: Strikes primitive fear into
lesser creatures like goblins, gnoums and children.
While worn, they check Morale every round.
2 t he brown scimitAr of gAlgenbeck: A stinking
sword you pulled from a military shit-ditch. D6 damage.
dr10 attack and defence while you wield it. 1 in 6 chance
a wounded enemy is smitten with potent sepsis, dying in
10 minutes.
3 w izArd teeth: Four weird teeth rattle within a
blackened pouch. Before battle roll a d6 for each one.
For every 6 one of your attacks deals maximum damage.
4 old sigûrd’s sling: Sigûrd was the strongest man whose
throat you ever gnawed. Woven from his long grey hair,
this sling has never failed you. 2d4 damage, requires fist-
sized rocks which, perhaps regrettably, are everywhere.
5 An cient gore-hound: Asthmatic, deluded and on its
last legs, this wizened creature still has a superb nose
and can sniffle up treasure in the most disgusting debris.
Attacks with dr10 (bite d6). Defends with dr12, 10 hp.
Becomes frenzied around goblins and berserkers.
6 the shoe of deAth’s horse: It looks normal but since
finding it in an obscure crypt you are convinced this shoe
came from the horse of Death himself. In your hands
it hits with dr10, d4 damage. 1 in 6 chance the shoe
smashes the skull, instantly killing small-to-medium
sized creatures. The shoe returns to your hand like a
boomerang.


**2. Gutterborn Scum**

An ill stAr smiled upon your birth. Poverty, crime and bad
parenting didn’t help either. In your community an honest day’s
work was never an option. Not that you ever tried, what are you,
some kind of mug? A razor blade and a moonless night are worth
a week of chump-work.

Begins with 1d6×10s and d2 Omens. hp: Toughness+d6

**Bad BirtH (d6)**

one-handed weapon, dealing normal damage +3.
2 filthy fingersmith: Your snaky little digits get into
pockets and pick locks with a dr8 Agility test. You also
begin with lockpicks!
3 AbominAble gob lobber: Your phlegm is viscous,
lumpy, vile and ballistically accurate at short range. You
can spit d2 times during a fight. Roll a dr8 Presence test
for accuracy. Targets are blinded, retching and vomiting
for d4 rounds. Anyone witnessing this—friend and foe—
must make a Toughness test to not also vomit. pcs test
dr10 and enemies dr12.
4 escAping fAte: Every time you use an omen there is
a 50% chance it is not spent.
5 excretAl steAlth: You have an astounding, almost
preternatural ability to hide in muck, debris and filth.
When hidden in these conditions a dr16 Presence test
is required to notice you.
6 dodging deAth: You are so unpleasant, irrelevant,
disgusting and vile even Death would rather avoid you if
it can. On death, if there is even the slightest possibility
that you survived, there is a 50% chance that you did.
If successful, after 10 rounds you pop back up with d4 hp
and an unlikely explanation of your escape.

The first time the Scum gets better (see Getting better, page 33)
another specialty is rolled. From the second time the Scum gets
better it’s possible to reroll these two specialities or just one.


**3. Esoteric hermit**

The stone of your cAve is one with the stars. Silence and
perfection. Now the chaos of a fallen world disturbs your rituals

armor table.


**yOu alsO BegiN witH ONe OF tHe FOllOwiNg (d6):**
1 mAster of fAte: What use are maps when the substance
of causality itself is open to you? You know the right way
with a dr8 Presence test.
2 b ook of boiling blood: You may open and read from
this book once a day. Your enemy must make a dr12 test
to prevent this. If they fail D2 Berserker-slayers (see page
59) appear from the depths of a forgotten dimension of
blood. Roll a D6. On a 1–4 these creatures fight alongside
you. On a 5–6 they turn on you, attempting to kill you
and destroy the book. After the battle they return to their
imprisonment.
3 s peAker of truths: Twice per day use your wisdom,
knowledge, advice and inner calm to bring clarity to
a creature of your choice. The dr of the next test they

to attack foes.

weapons table. Roll a d4 on the armor table but reroll if you
receive heavy armor.


**yOu BegiN witH twO OF tHe FOllOwiNg (d6):**
1 the blAde of your Ancestors: This magnificent
and clearly magical talking sword is foppish, unreliable
and quietly despises you. It taunts your failures and, if
continually disappointed, develops a 1 in 6 chance to
‘accidentally’ attack you or your companions. Deals d6+1
damage. Attack/Defence dr is 10.
2 ‘poltroon’ the court Jester: While practically
useless, personally irritating and an emotional drain,
Poltroon’s capering actually makes enemies lose their
focus in combat. For the first two rounds you and your
allies get +2 on attack/defence.
3 b ArbArister the incredible horse: Barbarister is
magical, intelligent, arrogant and vain. He can also talk.
If you can persuade him to care, Barbarister occasionally
adds +2 to Presence tests involving logic and intellect. The
horse may be smarter than you and is quite aware of this.
4 hAmfund the squire: This intensely cowardly servant
acts only as guardian for the scabbard of the cursed
sword Eurekia. Once per combat, if Ham can be found,
Eurekia may be drawn. The sword does 2d6 damage, and
for every swing of Eurekia roll a d6. On a 1 the squire is
slain and Eurekia vanishes forever.
5 t he snAke-skin gift: An expensive sandalwood box
bound in snakeskin. It contains a seemingly ordinary
dagger, wrapped in silk. The dagger does d4 damage
but on a 1 the target dies immediately of deadly poison
weeping from the blade.
6 horn of the schleswig lords! Once per day release
a blare from this dented old trumpet and test Presence
dr12. One creature may make their next non-combat test
an automatic success.

**yOu BegiN witH ONe OF tHe FOllOwiNg (d6):**
1 sAcred shepherd’s crook: Its head a hook of human
bone inscribed with overlapping anti-prayers. This crook
hooks through other worlds. Staff does 2d4 damage
except to faithless humans.
2 stolen mitre: While wearing this holy hat the priest’s
vile body fades, becoming hard to hit in combat (Defence
dr10). If pulled over the ears outside of battle the priest
becomes nearly invisible, testing stealth against dr8.
3 list of sins: A long and accurate document cross-
referenced against reality to discover unseen evil-doers.
Successful Presence dr10: A strange light surrounds evil
creatures. The list’s owner defends with +2 against any
being discovered this way.
4 the blAsphemous nechrubel bible: So intensely
blasphemous even the Priests themselves can only peruse
it once per day. When read, roll a die. Even result: For
the rest of the day pcs heal d4 hp after just five minutes
of rest. Odd result: The priest is plagued by demonic
hallucinations. The DM may invent d3 things that only the
Priest can see and describe them to the player as if true.
This effect ends with sunrise.
5 stones tAken from thel-emAs’ lost temple: Cast
the stones on the ground. Their pattern reveals if danger
lurks in an adjacent room. The stones can lie. The priest
tests Presence dr10 to see if they are true but after failing
they cannot test again until the sun has set.
666 (wrong Jesus) crucifix: The crucifix can be used
in encounters with the undead as well as lesser trolls
and goblins. Check morale (add or subtract the priest’s
Presence modifier) to see if the creatures bow and kindly
remove themselves.

**Seth, Goblin**

**HP** 6 **Morale** 7 **Ropy skin** -d2 **Knife/shortbow** d4
**Special:** Quick, attacks and defence are dr14.

All goblins cArry A curse. Once like you, they are now
trapped in the prison of their crazed goblin flesh. Only their
eyes reveal the truth: a ruined mind watching its body-prison
perform terrible deeds. Even being attacked by goblins sends the
curse, carried on the winds of their hate. Hit or miss, it doesn’t
matter. In the dark of Sarkash they shoot at passers-by with
twanging bows. You must find and kill the goblin before your
mind is paralyzed. If the cursecarrying creature still lives d6
days after the attack, you will warp irrevocably into one yourself.
Then, only the dark of Sarkash will hide you.

# Outcasts (followers)

Money might cross hAnds but these weirdos don’t cost silver
to hire. Vagrants and refugees driven by loneliness, they just want
somewhere to belong. Which is exactly why they often break into
a run and disappear, usually at the most critical moments.

The gm makes a morale check from time to time (succeed and the
outcast stays) and adds the group’s highest Presence to the roll.
The gm should also consider whether or not the group provides
the outcast with the things he/she/it values.
