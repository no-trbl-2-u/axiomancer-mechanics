# Combat

## Overview

Turn-based combat with rock-paper-scissors mechanics. All combat functions are pure and live in:

- `Combat/index.ts` — module barrel + small mechanics helpers (advantage, stats, dice, damage, health, effect queries).
- `Combat/combat.reducer.ts` — small `(state, …args) => newState` mutations on `CombatState`.
- `Combat/combat.resolver.ts` — `resolveCombatRound`, the single round-resolution entry point. Returns `{ state, combatEvents }` so any UI client (CLI, future React Native UI, automated tester) can drive combat without re-implementing the math. The orchestrator delegates to per-phase helpers in `Combat/phases/`:
  - `phases/round-start.ts` — regen / drain / start-phase DoT.
  - `phases/action-restriction.ts` — `forcedStance` / `blockedStance` / `skipTurn`.
  - `phases/advantage.ts` — type-advantage matchup + effect overrides.
  - `phases/stance-effects.ts` — clear stale Tier 1 buffs; apply this round's Tier 1.
  - `phases/scenario.ts` — skill / item / attack / defend resolution and stance-token generation (the largest phase).
  - `phases/round-end.ts` — end-phase DoT and effect expiry.

## Type System

Each round both combatants choose a `Stance`: `heart`, `body`, or `mind`.
Advantage is determined by rock-paper-scissors:

```
Heart > Body > Mind > Heart
```

| Matchup | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Heart vs Body | Heart has **advantage** |
| Body vs Mind | Body has **advantage** |
| Mind vs Heart | Mind has **advantage** |
| Same type | **Neutral** |
| Reverse of above | **Disadvantage** |

Advantage modifier (flat roll bonus/penalty from `getAdvantageModifier()`):
- Advantage: +2
- Neutral: 0
- Disadvantage: −2

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `attack` | Offensive — deals damage |
| `defend` | Defensive — reduces incoming damage |
| `skill` | Use an equipped skill (Phase 3) |
| `item` | Use an inventory item (Phase 4) |
| `flee` | Attempt to escape |

## Combat Phases

`choosing_stance` → `choosing_action` → `choosing_skill` → `resolving` → `ended`

The Combat CLI currently drives both selection phases inline rather than persisting them
on `state.phase`; the reducer still exposes `setPhase(state, phase)` for consumers that
want explicit phase tracking.

## Defense Multipliers

Applied to the defender's base defense stat when the `defend` action is chosen.
The multiplier depends on the defender's type-advantage over the attacker.

| Defender's Advantage | Multiplier |
|---------------------|------------|
| Advantage (picked the right counter-type) | 3× |
| Neutral (same type) | 2× |
| Disadvantage (wrong type) | 1.5× |
| Not defending (took damage after losing attack contest) | 1× (passive) |

## Round Flow (Current Implementation)

A single call to `resolveCombatRound(state, playerAction, enemyAction, lookupSkill?)`
runs every phase below and returns `{ state, combatEvents }`. The CLI prints the
event stream via `renderRoundEvents` in `combat.display.ts`; the resolver
itself never logs.

```
resolveCombatRound(state, playerAction, enemyAction, lookupSkill?)
├── 1. round-start          → processRoundStartEffects  → regen / drain / start-phase DoT
│                              (early exit if a combatant drops to 0 HP)
├── 2. action-restriction   → canAct                    → forced-stance / blocked-stance / skipTurn
├── 3. advantage            → resolveEffectiveAdvantage → matchup + per-side advantage label
├── 4. stance-effects       → clearTier1EffectsForStance + applyTier1CombatEffect
├── 5. scenario             → 'skill' routes through executeSkill (Spec 04);
│                              otherwise attack-vs-attack / attack-vs-defend / etc.
│                              Player basic actions also generate stance tokens
│                              into `combatResources` (hit +3 / miss +1 / defend +5).
└── 6. round-end            → end-phase DoT  → tickAllEffects  → log expired effects
                              + round counter increments
```

Events are emitted in the order above, grouped by `phase`:
`round-start` → `action-restriction` → `advantage` → `stance-effects` →
`skill` → `scenario` → `resources` → `round-end`. UI consumers render each
section from the typed `RoundEvent` union exported alongside the resolver.

## Tier 1 Auto-Effects

Every `attack` or `defend` action automatically applies a Tier 1 effect — no resist roll.
Switching action types removes the previous type's self-buff immediately via `clearTier1EffectsForStance()`.

| Action | Effect | Applied To |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Body + Attack | `tier1_body_attack` — Ad Baculum (physical attack stance) | self |
| Body + Defend | `tier1_body_defend` — Briar Stance (thorns reflect) | self |
| Mind + Attack | `tier1_mind_mark` — Exposed Reasoning (+1 intensity / +1 duration) | opponent |
| Mind + Defend | `tier1_mind_mark` — Exposed Reasoning (+3 intensity / +3 duration) | opponent |
| Heart + Attack | `tier1_heart_attack` — Fleeting Kindness (emotional pressure) | self |
| Heart + Defend | `tier1_heart_defend` — Vital Empathy (regen) | self |

## Effect-Based Combat Specials (Active)

These are live in `combat.resolver.ts` (no CLI inline math — the CLI just renders the events the resolver emits):

| Mechanic | When | What |
|----------|------|------|
| **Study Mark** (Mind/Attack) | Before damage roll | `getStudyMarkIntensity(enemy)` → added to damage roll as bonus |
| **Thorns Reflect** (Body/Defend) | After any hit on the bearer | `getThornsReflect(bearer)` → sums `reflectDamage × intensity`; dealt back to attacker |
| **Heart/Attack — strip buff** | On hit | `removeRandomBuff(enemy)` → one random enemy buff removed |
| **Heart/Attack — extend buff** | On hit | `extendRandomBuffDuration(player, 1)` → one random player buff gets +1 duration |
| **Heart/Attack — roll penalty** | Roll phase | −5 to the player's attack modifier |

## Spec 03 — Tier 2 / Tier 3 Effect Procs

Every basic `attack` or `defend` that lands a hit also rolls for effect procs from `combat-effects.library.json`. The proc table is organised as Stance × action × tier triples. Basic actors only roll the tier-1 entries; tier-2 and tier-3 procs are gated by per-cell unlocks on the actor (`procUnlocks` field on Character / Enemy).

**Trigger gate** — procs only fire on a successful hit (i.e. inside `resolveAttackHit`). The attacker rolls procs from their `attack` table; the defender, when they actively defended, additionally rolls procs from their `defend` table.

**Final proc chance** —

```
chance = baseChance
       + (stanceBaseStat       × 0.02)    // STAT_PROC_BONUS_PER_POINT
       + (statusChanceIntensity × 0.05)    // STATUS_CHANCE_BUFF_BONUS  (from buff_status_chance_up)
```

Clamped to [0, 1].

**Crit (nat 20 attack roll)** — every eligible proc in the table fires automatically with +1 intensity / +1 duration on top of the trigger's defaults.

**Fumble (nat 1 attack roll)** — applies the cell's `fumbleEffectId` to the actor as a self-debuff and skips other procs for that cell.

**Application path** — procs hand off to `applyEffect` (to materialise the ActiveEffect with the right intensity / duration) and then `resolveEffectApplication` (Tier 2 / 3 resist contest, rebound, crit-resist). Tier 1 procs auto-apply via `applyEffect` alone.

**Default proc matrix:**

| Stance / Action | Tier 1 (basic) | Tier 2 (unlock) | Tier 3 (unlock) | Fumble (self) |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Body / Attack | `debuff_post_hoc_tremor` (opponent, 10%) | `debuff_bleed` (opponent, 18%) | `debuff_petrify` (opponent, 6%) | `debuff_post_hoc_tremor` |
| Body / Defend | `buff_ad_hoc_patch` (self, 10%) | `buff_resistance_body` (self, 15%) | `buff_invincibility` (self, 5%) | `debuff_post_hoc_tremor` |
| Mind / Attack | `debuff_affirming_consequent` (opponent, 10%) | `debuff_daze` (opponent, 18%) | `debuff_petrify` (opponent, 6%) | `debuff_affirming_consequent` |
| Mind / Defend | `buff_gettiters_flicker` (self, 10%) | `buff_resistance_mind` (self, 15%) | `buff_haste` (self, 5%) | `debuff_affirming_consequent` |
| Heart / Attack | `debuff_straw_man_echo` (opponent, 10%) | `debuff_fear` (opponent, 18%) | `debuff_petrify` (opponent, 6%) | `debuff_straw_man_echo` |
| Heart / Defend | `buff_petitio_pulse` (self, 10%) | `buff_resistance_heart` (self, 15%) | `buff_invincibility` (self, 5%) | `debuff_straw_man_echo` |

**Enemy customisation (Q7)** — `Enemy.procOverrides` swaps the entire cell's table wholesale (used for bosses with signature procs and elite / basic enemies whose tables depend on the encounter map). `Enemy.procUnlocks` raises the per-cell tier cap independently.

**Switching (Q5)** — out of scope for this spec. The skill engine (Spec 04) will hook switching into a different effect pool; basic procs do not currently apply a switching multiplier.

## Effect Resistance Rules (`resolveEffectApplication`)

| Tier | Rule |
|------|------|
| **Tier 1** | Auto-applies. No roll made. |
| **Tier 2 Buff** | Only natural 1 (fumble) stops it. Natural 20 = crit focus → 2× intensity. |
| **Tier 2 Debuff** | Target rolls `d20 + resistStat` vs `DR = resistDR + attackerHeartBonus + equipBonus`. Natural 20 = rebound (effect bounces to attacker at 2× intensity). Natural 1 = overwhelmed (lands at 2× duration). Total ≥ DR = resisted. |
| **Tier 3** | Only natural 20 repels it. Everything else lands. |

DR formula: `effect.resistDR + attacker.baseStats.heart + equipmentBonus`
Resist stat: `target.baseStats[resistedBy]` (via `getResistStat()` in `Combat/stats.ts`).

## Friendship Path

Both combatants defending on the same round increments `friendshipCounter`.
Reaching `FRIENDSHIP_COUNTER_MAX` (3) ends combat with the `friendship` outcome.

## Combat End Conditions

`determineCombatEnd(state)` returns:

| Return | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| `'player'` | Enemy HP ≤ 0 |
| `'ko'` | Player HP ≤ 0 |
| `'friendship'` | `friendshipCounter >= FRIENDSHIP_COUNTER_MAX` |
| `'ongoing'` | None of the above |

## Battle Log

Each resolved round can append a `BattleLogEntry` via `addBattleLogEntry()`:

```typescript
{
  round, playerAction, enemyAction, advantage,
  playerRoll, playerRollDetails,
  enemyRoll, enemyRollDetails,
  damageToPlayer, damageToEnemy,
  playerHPAfter, enemyHPAfter,
  result
}
```

## Combat Reducer API

Defined in `src/Combat/combat.reducer.ts`. These are small, single-concept
state-shape mutations. The current names are on the left; legacy aliases are
listed where they exist for backwards compatibility.

| Function | Alias(es) | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `initializeCombat(player, enemy)` | — | Creates fresh CombatState with deep-cloned combatants |
| `setPhase(state, phase)` | `updateCombatPhase` | Transitions to a new combat phase |
| `setPlayerStance(state, stance)` | — | Sets the player's stance choice |
| `setPlayerAction(state, action)` | — | Sets the player's action choice |
| `appendLog(state, entry)` | `addBattleLogEntry` | Appends a battle log entry |
| `incrementFriendship(state)` | — | Increments the friendship counter |
| `endCombat(state)` | `endCombatPlayerVictory`, `endCombatPlayerDefeat`, `endCombatWithFriendship` | Marks combat as ended; the reason is encoded in `determineCombatEnd(state)` |

## Combat Resolver API

Defined in `src/Combat/combat.resolver.ts`. The resolver is the single
round-resolution entry point used by every UI client.

| Function / Type | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `resolveCombatRound(state, playerAction, enemyAction): RoundResolution` | Runs all six phases of one round and returns `{ state, combatEvents }`. Pure; only RNG source is `Math.random` inside dice rolls and effect selectors (stub via `src/test-utils/rng.ts`). |
| `RoundResolution` | `{ state: CombatState; combatEvents: RoundEvent[] }` |
| `RoundEvent` | Discriminated union, organised by `phase` (`round-start`, `action-restriction`, `advantage`, `stance-effects`, `scenario`, `round-end`). UIs render each phase as a section. |
| `CombatActor` | `'player' \| 'enemy'` — used by every event to identify which side it belongs to. |

## Combat Mechanics API

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `determineAdvantage(attacker, defender)` | Returns advantage relationship |
| `getAdvantageModifier(advantage)` | Returns +2 / 0 / −2 |
| `hasAdvantage(attacker, defender)` | Boolean shorthand |
| `determineEnemyAction(logic)` | AI-driven enemy action selection |
| `isCombatOngoing(state)` | True if combat should continue |
| `determineCombatEnd(state)` | Returns outcome or 'ongoing' |
| `getBaseStat(entity, stance)` | Raw base stat for a stance |
| `getAttackStat(entity, stance)` | Attack derived stat for a stance |
| `getDefenseStat(entity, stance)` | Defense derived stat for a stance |
| `getSaveStat(entity, stance)` | Save stat for a stance (enemies fall back to defense) |
| `getResistStat(entity, resistedBy)` | Base stat used when resisting an effect |
| `rollSkillCheck(baseStat, advantage)` | d20 + modifier with advantage/disadvantage |
| `calculateFinalDamage(base, reduction, crit, bonus)` | Damage after reductions |
| `applyDamage(entity, damage)` | Reduces HP (clamps to 0) |
| `heal(entity, amount)` (alias `healCharacter`) | Restores HP (clamps to max) |
| `resolveEffectApplication(target, effect, type, heart, equip)` | Full tier-based resist logic |
| `tickAllEffects(target)` | Decrements all effect durations |
| `getStudyMarkIntensity(target)` | Mind mark bonus for damage |
| `getThornsReflect(bearer)` | Thorns reflect damage total |
| `removeRandomBuff(target)` | Strips one random buff |
| `extendRandomBuffDuration(target, amount)` | Extends one random buff |
| `applyRegen(target)` | Sums and applies all regen effects |

## Pending (Phase 2)

- `createBattleLogEntry` / `formatAllBattleLogs` / `generateCombatResultMessage` — log utilities
- Skill / item actions in the resolver pipeline — Specs 04 / 05
- Spec 03 switching reward — currently out of scope; rolls into Spec 04's skill synergy work

### Landed in Spec 02

- `resolveCombatRound` (in `combat.resolver.ts`) replaces the CLI's inline
  attack / defend math; the CLI is now UI-only.
- Typed `RoundEvent` stream emitted alongside the new state for UI rendering.
- `canAct` / `getActiveEffectModifiers` are wired through the resolver.
- Symmetric defense (Q3): both player and enemy defenders now route through
  `getDefenseStat` instead of the asymmetric base-stat path the CLI used to
  use for the player.
