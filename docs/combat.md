# Combat

## Overview

Turn-based combat with rock-paper-scissors mechanics. All combat functions are pure and live in:

- `Combat/index.ts` — module barrel + small mechanics helpers (advantage, stats, dice, damage, health, effect queries).
- `Combat/combat.reducer.ts` — small `(state, …args) => newState` mutations on `CombatState`.
- `Combat/combat.resolver.ts` — `resolveCombatRound`, the single round-resolution entry point. Returns `{ state, combatEvents }` so any UI client (CLI, future React Native UI, automated tester) can drive combat without re-implementing the math. The orchestrator delegates to per-phase helpers in `Combat/phases/`:
  - `phases/round-start.ts` — regen / drain / start-phase DoT.
  - `phases/action-restriction.ts` — `forcedStance` / `blockedStance` / `skipTurn`.
  - `phases/advantage.ts` — type-advantage matchup + effect overrides.
  - `phases/stance-effects.ts` — clear stale Tier 1 buffs; apply this round's Tier 1.
  - `phases/scenario.ts` — skill / item / attack / defend resolution and stance-token generation (the largest phase).
  - `phases/round-end.ts` — end-phase DoT and effect expiry.

## Type System

Each round both combatants choose a `Stance`: `heart`, `body`, or `mind`.
Advantage is determined by rock-paper-scissors:

```
Heart > Body > Mind > Heart
```

| Matchup | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Heart vs Body | Heart has **advantage** |
| Body vs Mind | Body has **advantage** |
| Mind vs Heart | Mind has **advantage** |
| Same type | **Neutral** |
| Reverse of above | **Disadvantage** |

Advantage modifier (flat roll bonus/penalty from `getAdvantageModifier()`):
- Advantage: +2
- Neutral: 0
- Disadvantage: −2

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `attack` | Offensive — deals damage |
| `defend` | Defensive — reduces incoming damage |
| `skill` | Use a learned/unlocked skill that is currently affordable (Spec 04 / 04b; legacy equipped gate removed in Phase 98) |
| `item` | Use an inventory consumable (Spec 05 / 05b) |
| `flee` | Attempt to escape |
| `spare` | Phase 108 — mercy choice to spare/befriend the enemy (sets `friendshipResolutionAuthorized`) |
| `exploit` | Phase 108 — mercy choice to exploit the opening for a free critical attack |

## Combat Phases

`choosing_stance` → `choosing_action` → `choosing_skill` → `mercy_choice` → `resolving` → `ended`

The `mercy_choice` phase activates after a successful Befriend skill cast, presenting
the player with a choice between `spare` (mercy/friendship) and `exploit` (critical attack).

The Combat CLI currently drives both selection phases inline rather than persisting them
on `state.phase`; the reducer still exposes `setPhase(state, phase)` for consumers that
want explicit phase tracking.

## Defense Multipliers

Applied to the defender's base defense stat when the `defend` action is chosen.
The multiplier depends on the defender's type-advantage over the attacker.

| Defender's Advantage | Multiplier |
|---------------------|------------|
| Advantage (picked the right counter-type) | 3× |
| Neutral (same type) | 2× |
| Disadvantage (wrong type) | 1.5× |
| Not defending (took damage after losing attack contest) | 1× (passive) |

## Round Flow (Current Implementation)

A single call to `resolveCombatRound(state, playerAction, enemyAction, lookupSkill?)`
runs every phase below and returns `{ state, combatEvents }`. The CLI prints the
event stream via `renderRoundEvents` in `combat.display.ts`; the resolver
itself never logs.

```

                              + round counter increments
```

Events are emitted in the order above, grouped by `phase`:
`round-start` → `action-restriction` → `advantage` → `stance-effects` →
`skill` → `scenario` → `resources` → `round-end`. UI consumers render each
section from the typed `RoundEvent` union exported alongside the resolver.

## Tier 1 Auto-Effects

Every `attack` or `defend` action automatically applies a Tier 1 effect — no resist roll.
Switching action types removes the previous type's self-buff immediately via `clearTier1EffectsForStance()`.

| Action | Effect | Applied To |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Body + Attack | `tier1_body_attack` — Ad Baculum (physical attack stance) | self |
| Body + Defend | `tier1_body_defend` — Briar Stance (thorns reflect) | self |
| Mind + Attack | `tier1_mind_mark` — Exposed Reasoning (+1 intensity / +1 duration) | opponent |
| Mind + Defend | `tier1_mind_mark` — Exposed Reasoning (+3 intensity / +3 duration) | opponent |
| Heart + Attack | `tier1_heart_attack` — Fleeting Kindness (emotional pressure) | self |
| Heart + Defend | `tier1_heart_defend` — Vital Empathy (regen) | self |

## Effect-Based Combat Specials (Active)

These are live in `combat.resolver.ts` (no CLI inline math — the CLI just renders the events the resolver emits):

| Mechanic | When | What |
|----------|------|------|
| **Study Mark** (Mind/Attack) | Before damage roll | `getStudyMarkIntensity(enemy)` → added to damage roll as bonus |
| **Thorns Reflect** (Body/Defend) | After any hit on the bearer | `getThornsReflect(bearer)` → sums `reflectDamage × intensity`; dealt back to attacker |
| **Heart/Attack — strip buff** | On hit | `removeRandomBuff(enemy)` → one random enemy buff removed |
| **Heart/Attack — extend buff** | On hit | `extendRandomBuffDuration(player, 1)` → one random player buff gets +1 duration |
| **Heart/Attack — roll penalty** | Roll phase | −5 to the player's attack modifier |

## Spec 03 — Tier 2 / Tier 3 Effect Procs

Every basic `attack` or `defend` that lands a hit also rolls for effect procs from `combat-effects.library.json`. The proc table is organised as Stance × action × tier triples. Basic actors only roll the tier-1 entries; tier-2 and tier-3 procs are gated by per-cell unlocks on the actor (`procUnlocks` field on Character / Enemy).

**Trigger gate** — procs only fire on a successful hit (i.e. inside `resolveAttackHit`). The attacker rolls procs from their `attack` table; the defender, when they actively defended, additionally rolls procs from their `defend` table.

**Final proc chance** —

```
chance = baseChance
       + (stanceBaseStat       × 0.02)    // STAT_PROC_BONUS_PER_POINT
       + (statusChanceIntensity × 0.05)    // STATUS_CHANCE_BUFF_BONUS  (from buff_status_chance_up)
```

Clamped to [0, 1].

**Crit (nat 20 attack roll)** — every eligible proc in the table fires automatically with +1 intensity / +1 duration on top of the trigger's defaults.

**Fumble (nat 1 attack roll)** — applies the cell's `fumbleEffectId` to the actor as a self-debuff and skips other procs for that cell.

**Application path** — procs hand off to `applyEffect` (to materialise the ActiveEffect with the right intensity / duration) and then `resolveEffectApplication` (Tier 2 buff caster fumble/crit; Tier 2 debuff + Tier 3 always land post-Phase-80). Tier 1 procs auto-apply via `applyEffect` alone.

**Default proc matrix:**

| Stance / Action | Tier 1 (basic) | Tier 2 (unlock) | Tier 3 (unlock) | Fumble (self) |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Body / Attack | `debuff_post_hoc_tremor` (opponent, 10%) | `debuff_bleed` (opponent, 18%) | `debuff_petrify` (opponent, 6%) | `debuff_post_hoc_tremor` |
| Body / Defend | `buff_ad_hoc_patch` (self, 10%) | `buff_resistance_body` (self, 15%) | `buff_invincibility` (self, 5%) | `debuff_post_hoc_tremor` |
| Mind / Attack | `debuff_affirming_consequent` (opponent, 10%) | `debuff_daze` (opponent, 18%) | `debuff_petrify` (opponent, 6%) | `debuff_affirming_consequent` |
| Mind / Defend | `buff_gettiters_flicker` (self, 10%) | `buff_resistance_mind` (self, 15%) | `buff_haste` (self, 5%) | `debuff_affirming_consequent` |
| Heart / Attack | `debuff_straw_man_echo` (opponent, 10%) | `debuff_fear` (opponent, 18%) | `debuff_petrify` (opponent, 6%) | `debuff_straw_man_echo` |
| Heart / Defend | `buff_petitio_pulse` (self, 10%) | `buff_resistance_heart` (self, 15%) | `buff_invincibility` (self, 5%) | `debuff_straw_man_echo` |

**Enemy customisation (Q7)** — `Enemy.procOverrides` swaps the entire cell's table wholesale (used for bosses with signature procs and elite / basic enemies whose tables depend on the encounter map). `Enemy.procUnlocks` raises the per-cell tier cap independently.

**Switching (Q5)** — out of scope for this spec. The skill engine (Spec 04) will hook switching into a different effect pool; basic procs do not currently apply a switching multiplier.

## Effect Application Rules (`resolveEffectApplication`)

| Tier | Rule |
|------|------|
| **Tier 1** | Auto-applies. No roll made. |
| **Tier 2 Buff** | Caster d20: natural 1 = fumble (buff fails, `buff-fumbled` event). Natural 20 = crit focus → 2× intensity. Any other = auto-succeeds. |
| **Tier 2 Debuff** | **Always lands.** No target-resist roll. No rebound. No overwhelmed. (Phase 80 — direction (a) pure split.) |
| **Tier 3** | **Always lands.** Inescapable. (Phase 80 — Nat-20 escape removed.) |

See `docs/effects.md` for the full per-tier breakdown and stacking rules.

## Damage Resistance (Phase 93)

Phase 93 completes Phase 80's direction (a) "pure split": effects always land (Phase 80), damage applies resistance separately (Phase 93).

Skills now apply damage resistance based on the target's stats:
- **Physical damage** (body-scaling skills) → reduced by target's body stat
- **Mental damage** (mind-scaling skills) → reduced by target's mind stat  
- **Emotional damage** (heart-scaling skills) → reduced by target's heart stat

**Linear resistance model:** Each point of resistance stat reduces damage by 1.
**Minimum damage:** Damage is clamped to at least 1 (high resistance reduces but never completely negates damage).

```typescript
// Physical skill against high-body target
const damage = calculateSkillDamage(caster, bodySkill, target);
// If bodySkill would deal 10 damage, but target has 7 body stat,
// final damage = 10 - 7 = 3

// Very high resistance still allows minimum damage
// If target has 15 body stat vs 10 damage, result = 1 (not 0)
```

This affects `calculateSkillDamage` when a target is provided. Calls without a target maintain backward compatibility (no resistance applied).

## Friendship Path

Both combatants defending on the same round increments `friendshipCounter`.
Reaching `FRIENDSHIP_COUNTER_MAX` (3) ends combat with the `friendship`
outcome — UNLESS the enemy carries a per-enemy `befriendabilityConfig`
override (Phase 68), in which case ALL of its named predicates must pass
simultaneously before friendship triggers. See § "Per-enemy predicate
(Phase 68 — `BefriendabilityConfig`)" below for the override semantics.

When the Game store's `endCombat()` resolves a friendship exit (Phase 36),
the returned `CombatEndReport` carries:

- `outcome: 'friendship'` (distinct from `'flee'`)
- `xpGained: floor(totalEncounterXp * 0.5) + friendshipReward?.xpBonus` —
  half the kill-win XP plus any per-enemy bonus (Phase 60)
- `loot: rollEncounterLoot(encounter) ++ friendshipReward?.items` —
  the full weighted-loot roll with any per-enemy guaranteed items
  appended (Phase 60)
- `friendshipReward?: { narrative?, alignmentShift?, codexEntryUnlocked? }`
  (Phase 60 + 69 + 73) — present only when the befriended enemy
  carries an authored `friendshipReward` with `narrative` /
  `alignmentDelta`, OR a `journalEntry` that wasn't already
  unlocked. Engine doesn't interpret `narrative`; CLI / UI renders.
  `alignmentShift` (Phase 69) carries the post-clamp
  `PhilosophicalAlignment` the reducer just wrote to
  `state.philosophicalAlignment` — surface parity for consumers
  that don't subscribe separately. `codexEntryUnlocked` (Phase 73)
  carries `{ id, title }` for the newly-unlocked codex entry;
  body is looked up against the source `Enemy.journalEntry`.
- **State side effect (Phase 62)** — when the befriended enemy carries
  `friendshipReward.flagSet?: string`, the END_COMBAT reducer appends
  the flag to `state.flags` (de-duped). Downstream dialogue choices /
  quest objectives can gate on the flag via the existing
  `DialogueChoice.requires.flag` machinery — no new engine surface
  for the consumer. Convention is `befriended-<enemy-id-stem>` (e.g.
  `befriended-mournful-gull`). The flag does NOT surface on the report.
- **State side effect (Phase 69)** — when the befriended enemy carries
  `friendshipReward.alignmentDelta?: Partial<PhilosophicalAlignment>`,
  the END_COMBAT reducer applies the delta to
  `state.philosophicalAlignment` via `applyAlignmentDelta` (Phase 42
  clamp helper; each axis clamps to `[-100, +100]`, missing axes pass
  through). Closes Spec 14 Q4. Authoring band: ±1..±5 per axis (matches
  the Phase 43 dialogue / map-event delta convention). The post-clamp
  cell surfaces on `CombatEndReport.friendshipReward.alignmentShift`.
- **State side effect (Phase 73 — closes GH#65 ask 3)** — when the
  befriended enemy carries `journalEntry?: CodexEntry`
  (`{ id, title, body }`), the END_COMBAT reducer appends the
  entry's id to `state.codex.unlockedEntries` (de-duped). The
  store layer surfaces `{ id, title }` on
  `CombatEndReport.friendshipReward.codexEntryUnlocked` only when
  the entry wasn't already unlocked — repeat befriends don't
  re-fire the report field. Body is recovered at consumer render
  time via lookup against the source `Enemy` (or a future
  `CodexLibrary` registry). Victory / defeat / flee outcomes do
  NOT unlock the entry; future content can grant entries outside
  combat via `store.unlockCodexEntry(entryId)`.

The reducer side (Phase 10) also shifts the moral meter `+1` (see
`docs/morality.md` § "Combat: Friendship Victories") and routes the player
through `applyLevelUps` if the (now possibly-bonused) XP crossed a threshold.

### Befriendable-enemy content (Phase 60)

Per-enemy `Enemy.friendshipReward?: FriendshipReward` lets authors
attach bonus content to the friendship resolution. Seven enemies ship
authored rewards (Phase 102 expanded from 3 → 7):

| Enemy | Items | xpBonus | Narrative |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MournfulGull** (normal) | 1 × heart-draught | +10 | "The gull stops circling. It settles on the rail beside you. For a long moment, neither of you speaks the slights you remember." |
| **HollowEyedBeggar** (normal) | 1 × healing-potion + 1 × antidote | +15 | "They pull a folded cloth from somewhere inside the rags. Two phials, both still cold. \"I was carrying these for someone,\" they say. \"But you stopped. So.\"" |
| **TideflukeReaver** (elite, Phase 102) | 1 × body-elixir + 1 × healing-potion | +35 | "The salt-bound reaver's chains dissolve into foam. For the first time in memory, its fists unclench." |
| **HushWraith** (elite, Phase 102) | 1 × clarity-serum + 1 × antidote | +40 | "The wraith's silence breaks into whisper. 'I have been listening to the wrong questions,' it says..." |
| **HollowSaint** (elite, Phase 102) | 1 × resonance-crystal + 1 × heart-draught + 1 × healing-potion | +45 | "The hollow saint finds purpose in witness. 'I have been looking for a cause to die for,' it says..." |
| **CoastalTyrant** (boss) | paradox-loop + healing-potion + heart-draught | +75 | "For five rounds the magistrate has refused to strike. The sword stays low..." |
| **TheDisagreement** (boss, Phase 102) | 1 × philosopher-tea + 1 × focus-vial + 1 × healing-potion + 1 × clarity-serum | +80 | "The disagreement resolves into dialogue. 'You argued back properly,' it says..." |

`FriendshipReward` is `{ items?: Item[]; xpBonus?: number; narrative?:
string }`. Items are appended to the weighted-loot roll, xpBonus is
additive on top of the half-XP base, and `narrative` surfaces on
`CombatEndReport.friendshipReward.narrative` for the consumer to
render. Enemies without an authored `friendshipReward` resolve via the
Phase 36 base only (the report's `friendshipReward` field is
`undefined`). See `docs/enemy.md` § "Befriendable enemies (Phase 60)"
for authoring guidance.

### Per-enemy predicate (Phase 68 — `BefriendabilityConfig`)

`Enemy.befriendabilityConfig?: BefriendabilityConfig` overrides the
Phase 36 friendship-eligibility predicate per enemy. When absent, the
Phase 36 mechanic stays unchanged. When present, ALL of its named
fields AND-compose; eligibility requires every named predicate to pass
simultaneously. Within a single list-valued predicate, the match is
existential (at least one element).

| Field | Semantics |
|---|---|
| `roundsThreshold?: number` | Per-enemy override of `FRIENDSHIP_COUNTER_MAX`. Defaults to the global value (3) when absent on a config that sets other fields. |
| `hpGate?: { belowPct: number }` | Enemy HP fraction must be ≤ `belowPct` at the eligibility check. Pure snapshot — healing back above the threshold un-qualifies. Range [0, 1]. |
| `requiredStances?: Stance[]` | Player must have used at least one of the named stances during combat (existential). Derived from `state.log[].playerAction.stance`. Empty array = no requirement. |
| `requiredSkillUse?: string[]` | Player must have cast at least one of the named skill IDs during combat (existential). Derived from `state.log[].playerAction` entries with `action === 'skill'`. Empty array = no requirement. |
| `defaultFallback?: 'both-defend-cap'` | Explicit "fall through to Phase 36". When set, other fields are ignored for THIS enemy; eligibility uses the global counter cap exactly. |

The engine helper that evaluates the predicate is
`isFriendshipEligible(state: CombatState): boolean` in
`src/Combat/index.ts`. It is **not** on the public barrel — engine
consumers read combat-end state through `determineCombatEnd` /
`isCombatOngoing`, both of which call it so the two predicates stay in
lockstep.

The counter still increments freely on both-defend rounds (Phase 36
unchanged); friendship triggers only when ALL config predicates pass
together. A player can "bank" defends past `roundsThreshold` and have
friendship trigger later (e.g. once `hpGate` clears via damage progress).

Coastal Tyrant is the first boss-tier authored config (Phase 68):

```typescript
// CoastalTyrant (boss; alignment faith-pessimistic-transcendent)
befriendabilityConfig: {
    hpGate: { belowPct: 0.4 },
    requiredStances: ['heart'],
    roundsThreshold: 3, // Phase 101 — reduced from 5 for mercy policy viability
},
```

The fallen magistrate-priest opens his friendship arc only after he's
been brought low (HP ≤ 40%), the player has shown empathy at least
once (heart stance), and 3 both-defend rounds have passed. The
authored `friendshipReward` content (multi-paragraph narrative + items)
is deferred to the boss-tier befriendable-enemy follow-up phase.

### Friendship Resolution Authority (Phase 112)

Phase 112 hardened the Befriend doctrine to ensure friendship resolution
is always explicit and intentional. **Passive friendship counter pressure
alone no longer ends combat.** The friendship outcome requires:

1. **Explicit Befriend skill cast** — the player must actively use the
   Befriend skill (5 heart tokens) when the enemy is vulnerable.
2. **Mercy choice selection** — successful Befriend opens a choice between
   `spare` (mercy/friendship) and `exploit` (critical attack).
3. **Authorization flag** — only `spare` choice sets
   `state.friendshipResolutionAuthorized = true`, enabling the friendship
   combat end.

Both-defend friendship counters still increment normally and contribute to
`BefriendabilityConfig` thresholds, but they are no longer sufficient by
themselves. This prevents silent bypassing of:
- The 5-heart Befriend cost
- The explicit mercy choice moment
- HP-gate and other authored eligibility requirements

The `isFriendshipEligible(state)` predicate now checks
`state.friendshipResolutionAuthorized === true` rather than counter/config
predicates directly.

## Combat End Conditions

`determineCombatEnd(state)` returns:

| Return | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| `'player'` | Enemy HP ≤ 0 OR effects-driven victory (Phase 125) |
| `'ko'` | Player HP ≤ 0 |
| `'friendship'` | `state.friendshipResolutionAuthorized === true` — set only when player casts Befriend + chooses `spare` (Phase 112) OR effects-driven friendship (Phase 125) |
| `'ongoing'` | None of the above |

### Effects-Driven Resolution (Phase 125)

Phase 125 allows status effects to force combat resolution instead of timeout, rewarding status-effect-heavy play styles. `getEffectsResolutionOutcome(state)` analyzes the enemy's active effects and can trigger two resolution paths:

**Saturation Yield (→ friendship)**: When the enemy is overwhelmed by control and debuff effects, it yields. The combined intensity of control effects plus stat-debuffing effects must reach `EFFECTS_RESOLUTION_DEBUFF_INTENSITY_THRESHOLD` (tunable, default 8). This routes through the existing `'friendship'` outcome for stable rewards (half XP + full loot). Phase 155 — a control effect that is *actively restricting* the enemy (`forcedStance` / `blockedStances` / `skipTurn`) also credits its remaining lock duration (capped) toward this sum, so exploiting a decisive multi-round lock saturates the enemy even at base intensity.

**DoT Erosion (→ victory)**: When damage-over-time effects can realistically finish the enemy, combat resolves to victory. Total DoT damage per round must exceed `EFFECTS_RESOLUTION_DOT_DAMAGE_THRESHOLD` (tunable, default 5) and be able to finish the enemy within ~10 rounds. Phase 155 — the route credits the **guaranteed pending DoT already locked in** (`Σ damagePerRound × intensity × remainingDuration`) against effective enemy HP, so a strategist who has stacked a lethal-in-flight DoT package resolves the fight they have already won instead of trading turns to the round cap. The per-round threshold gate is retained, so a trickle DoT still cannot force a premature win. This routes through the existing `'victory'` outcome for full XP and loot.

Effects resolution integrates with existing combat-end logic:
- Checked after HP conditions but before manual friendship authorization  
- Uses existing `CombatEndReport.outcome` union values (no new outcome types)
- Preserves round cap unchanged — effects provide resolution, not more time
- Thresholds are registry tunables for balance iteration

This closes the high-engagement timeout issue where players dominating via status effects couldn't complete fights within the round limit.

## Battle Log

`CombatState.log: BattleLogEntry[]` is an opt-in coarse summary slot from
the pre-Phase-9 combat design. `appendLog(state, entry)` is the reducer
that pushes one row:

```typescript
{
  round, playerAction, enemyAction, advantage,
  playerRoll, playerRollDetails,
  enemyRoll, enemyRollDetails,
  damageToPlayer, damageToEnemy,
  playerHPAfter, enemyHPAfter,
  result
}
```

The live per-round signal that consumers actually subscribe to is the
`RoundEvent[]` stream returned by `resolveCombatRound` — it carries every
phase / kind / sub-event (attack-roll, damage-applied, effect-application,
heal, resist, friendship-counter ticks, ...). The CLI threads that
stream onto the `combat:round` event payload and the agent-e2e state log
via `store.updateCombat(next, combatEvents)`. `appendLog` remains on the
public barrel for any consumer that wants the summary shape; the combat
resolver itself never populates it.

**Contract validation (Phase 96):** `resolveCombatRound` validates all
required parameters at entry to prevent runtime contract divergence issues
where BattleLogEntry fields might be undefined. If undefined `playerAction`
or `enemyAction` are passed, the function throws early with descriptive errors.

## Combat Reducer API

Defined in `src/Combat/combat.reducer.ts`. These are small, single-concept
state-shape mutations. The current names are on the left; legacy aliases are
listed where they exist for backwards compatibility.

| Function | Alias(es) | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `initializeCombat(player, enemy)` | — | Creates fresh CombatState with deep-cloned combatants |
| `setPhase(state, phase)` | — | Transitions to a new combat phase |
| `setPlayerStance(state, stance)` | — | Sets the player's stance choice |
| `setPlayerAction(state, action)` | — | Sets the player's action choice |
| `appendLog(state, entry)` | — | Appends a battle log entry |
| `incrementFriendship(state)` | — | Increments the friendship counter |
| `endCombat(state)` | — | Marks combat as ended; the reason is encoded in `determineCombatEnd(state)` |

## Combat Resolver API

Defined in `src/Combat/combat.resolver.ts`. The resolver is the single
round-resolution entry point used by every UI client.

| Function / Type | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `resolveCombatRound(state, playerAction, enemyAction): RoundResolution` | Runs all six phases of one round and returns `{ state, combatEvents }`. Pure; only RNG source is `Math.random` inside dice rolls and effect selectors (stub via `src/test-utils/rng.ts`). |
| `RoundResolution` | `{ state: CombatState; combatEvents: RoundEvent[] }` |
| `RoundEvent` | Discriminated union, organised by `phase` (`round-start`, `action-restriction`, `advantage`, `stance-effects`, `scenario`, `round-end`). UIs render each phase as a section. |
| `CombatActor` | `'player' \| 'enemy'` — used by every event to identify which side it belongs to. |

## Combat Mechanics API

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `determineAdvantage(attacker, defender)` | Returns advantage relationship |
| `getAdvantageModifier(advantage)` | Returns +2 / 0 / −2 |
| `hasAdvantage(attacker, defender)` | Boolean shorthand |
| `determineEnemyAction(logic)` | AI-driven enemy action selection |
| `isCombatOngoing(state)` | True if combat should continue |
| `determineCombatEnd(state)` | Returns outcome or 'ongoing' |
| `getBaseStat(entity, stance)` | Raw base stat for a stance |
| `getAttackStat(entity, stance)` | Attack derived stat for a stance |

## Hazard-Pattern Combat (Spec 25)

A second, additive combat driver that ships **alongside** `resolveCombatRound`
(the effects + skill engines are unchanged). It is a card-and-dice system
structurally mirrored on the Hazard minigame: every verb is a skill card, and
status effects fill two **Pressure Tracks** that are the only practical win
conditions — **DoT Erosion** (cumulative damage-over-time) and **Control
Saturation** (cumulative control/debuff). Basic-attack trading is gone as a
concept; the doctrine path (status effects = the main fun) is now the structural
path. Full design: [`specs/25-hazard-pattern-combat.md`](../specs/25-hazard-pattern-combat.md).

The engine lives in `src/Combat/`:

- `combat.engine.ts` — phase loop (`resolveCombatPhase` / `playCombatCard` /
  `resolveThreatPhase` / `processBetweenPhases`), RPS die-cost scaling, the
  self-reinforcing die-refresh loop, and `buildCombatSummary`.
- `combat.dice.ts` — the four colored mana dice and their state machine.
- `combat.deck.ts` — Fisher-Yates shuffle + draw-up-to-`COMBAT_HAND_SIZE`.
- `combat.cards.ts` — the skill→card adapter and verb classification.
- `combat.pressure.ts` — the two Pressure Tracks, momentum carry, and the
  `dotErosionReached` / `controlSaturationReached` thresholds.
- `combat.threat.ts` — authored + generated enemy threat sequences.
- `combat.encounter.sim.ts` — `simulateHazardPatternCombat`, a Monte-Carlo
  greedy bot used for balance evidence.

### Hazard-Pattern Combat API

### Spec 26 / 26b — stance draft, the read, Conviction, Signature Skills, deckbuilding

A depth layer built **on top of** the Spec 25 Hazard engine (it does not replace
it). It turns each turn into a small read-and-commit decision and adds two
progression levers, keeping status effects the win path.

> "Spec 26b" (stance draft / Conviction / Signature Skills / deckbuilder) is
> in-flight scaffolding carried in via PR #184; it has no spec file of its own
> yet, and is distinct from
> [`specs/26-catalyst-multiplicative-scaling.md`](../specs/26-catalyst-multiplicative-scaling.md).

- **Stance draft + the read.** Each turn rolls a small pool of dice
  (`TURN_DICE_COUNT`); the player **drafts** one as their stance — the unpicked
  die is not wasted (it grants Conviction and can carry forward). The enemy's
  phase stance is hidden behind a thematic hint; the drafted die's color is the
  player's **read** of it. A winning read (`resolveRead` → `advantage`)
  multiplies the pressure of cards played that turn (`READ_PRESSURE_MULT`), and a
  card whose stance matches the drafted die color earns a flat
  `COLOR_MATCH_PRESSURE_BONUS`. Reading the hidden stance is therefore the
  primary lever for amplifying status pressure — the doctrine path.
- **Conviction (◆).** A second resource that accrues from the unpicked draft die
  (`CONVICTION_PER_UNPICKED_DIE`) and from winning the read
  (`CONVICTION_READ_WIN_BONUS`). It funds Signature Skills.
- **Signature Skills.** A small, **always-available** kit (`SIGNATURE_SKILLS`,
  `SIGNATURE_KITS`, biased per `playerArchetype`) independent of the shuffled
  deck — the reliable plan through a bad draw. Played via `playSignatureSkill`,
  gated on Conviction.
- **Deckbuilding.** After a won combat, `rollCombatCardRewards` offers a
  1-of-N card draft (archetype-biased) that `addRewardCard` appends to the
  player's persistent collection. New *skills* (a new card type) are unlocked
  rarely via ethical-dilemma events through the `unlockSkillViaDilemma` hook;
  a new player starts with `STARTING_SKILL_ID` only.

| Function / Type | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `startTurn` / `endTurn` | Open a turn (roll the draft pool) / close it (resolve carry + upkeep). |
| `draftStanceDie(state, dieId)` / `getDraftedDie` / `chooseDraft` | Commit one die as the stance; read the committed die. |
| `resolveRead(dieColor, enemyStance)` → `CombatReadResult` | The drafted die vs the hidden enemy stance: `advantage` / `neutral` / `disadvantage` / `none`. |
| `isPhaseStanceRevealed` / `revealedCurrentStance` | Whether (and what) the enemy's hidden stance is now known. |
| `cardReadPreview` / `projectCardPressure` | UI previews — a card's read result + color match, and its projected pressure. |
| `discardCombatCard` | Discard a card from hand (tempo/sculpting). |
| `playSignatureSkill(state, id, ...)` / `getSignatureSkill` | Spend Conviction on an always-available Signature Skill. |
| `SIGNATURE_SKILLS` / `SIGNATURE_SKILL_LIST` / `SIGNATURE_KITS` / `signaturesForArchetype` / `playerArchetype` | The signature kit catalogue + per-archetype selection. |
| `rollCombatCardRewards` / `addRewardCard` / `COMBAT_REWARD_POOL` | Post-combat deckbuilder draft + persist. |
| `unlockSkillViaDilemma` / `STARTING_SKILL_ID` | Forward hook for ethical-dilemma skill unlocks; the new-player starting card. |
| `READ_PRESSURE_MULT`, `CONVICTION_PER_UNPICKED_DIE`, `CONVICTION_READ_WIN_BONUS`, `COLOR_MATCH_PRESSURE_BONUS`, `TURN_DICE_COUNT` | Tuning constants for the read / Conviction / draft economy. |
| `rollTurnDice` / `dieHasStance` / `deriveIntentType` | Draft-pool roll + stance helpers. |
| `CombatIntentType`, `CombatReadResult`, `SignatureSkill`, `SignatureSkillId`, `SignatureSkillKind`, `PlayerArchetype` | The depth-layer type family. |

The whole roster is now authored for this system: `combat.threat-sequences.ts`
ships a deterministic, fully-telegraphed threat pattern for all 62 library
enemies (each phase declares a hidden stance + relative DoT/control weakness so
both win paths stay live), and `combat.threat.ts` scales clear thresholds by
level + difficulty rather than raw HP so status pressure (which is HP-independent)
out-races the roster.

## Pending

The Spec 02 / 03 / 04 / 05 work this section used to track has
shipped. Combat is exercised end-to-end via `resolveCombatRound`
through the six `Combat/phases/` files; skill and item actions live in
`phases/scenario.ts`; Tier 2/3 procs are in `Combat/combat-effects.ts`.
The CLI log utilities were dropped when Phase 17 unified the CLI
surface around `npm run game` — no log strings exist in the engine
today; consumers render directly from the typed `RoundEvent` stream.

### Landed in Spec 02

- `resolveCombatRound` (in `combat.resolver.ts`) replaces the CLI's inline
  attack / defend math; the CLI is now UI-only.
- Typed `RoundEvent` stream emitted alongside the new state for UI rendering.
- `canAct` / `getActiveEffectModifiers` are wired through the resolver.
- Symmetric defense (Q3): both player and enemy defenders now route through
  `getDefenseStat` instead of the asymmetric base-stat path the CLI used to
  use for the player.
