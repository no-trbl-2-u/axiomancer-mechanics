# Axiomancer — Mechanics Engine

Turn-based RPG engine with Heart/Body/Mind combat. Status effects, skills, and enemies are themed around logical fallacies and philosophical paradoxes.

This repository is the game engine only — not the final game. It will be consumed as a library by a React Native mobile app.
