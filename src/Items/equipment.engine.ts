/**
 * Equipment & Consumable Engine — combat-side helpers for Spec 05.
 *
 * Pure functions that the combat resolver and the game store consume to wire
 * equipment and consumables into combat:
 *
 *   - `aggregateCombatStartTokens` — sums `combatStartTokens` across every
 *     equipped piece. The resolver folds the result into `combatResources`
 *     in `initializeCombat` so battles can begin with non-zero stance / phil
 *     counters when the wearer carries Berserker Band-style accessories.
 *   - `applyEquipmentGenerationBonus` — folds equipment `generationBonus`
 *     entries on top of the base `generateBasicActionResources` table.
 *   - `getEquipmentProcTriggers` — assembles the `EquipmentProcTrigger[]` the
 *     combat resolver appends to the Spec 03 proc roll for an `attack` or
 *     `defend` action.
 *   - `useConsumableEffect` — resolves a consumable's heal / effect payload
 *     against the caller's `ActiveEffect` array and HP, returning the new
 *     player snapshot. The caller decrements the inventory stack itself via
 *     the existing `useConsumable` reducer.
