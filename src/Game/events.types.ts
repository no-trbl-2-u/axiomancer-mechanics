/**
 * Typed event surface (post-Phase-21).
 *
 * The engine emits one uniform envelope from `eventForAction` in
 * `src/Game/store.ts`:
 *
 *   { type, payload: { action, state, report? } }
 *
 * `TypedGameEvent<T>` narrows the `type` field for consumers; the
 * `payload` shape is the same for every topic. Per-topic aliases
 * (`TypedCombatStartedEvent`, ...) cover all 10 `GameEventType`
 * values so the narrowed type is concrete at every guard call site.
 *
 * Pre-Phase-21 also shipped seven per-topic Payload interfaces
 * (`CombatStartedPayload`, etc.) and corresponding `create*Event`
 * factories. The interfaces were aspirational — the engine never
 * produced them — and the factories had zero internal callers, so
 * they were removed. A future phase can introduce richer per-topic
 * payloads via a deliberate engine-side rewrite if the UI surface
 * needs them.
