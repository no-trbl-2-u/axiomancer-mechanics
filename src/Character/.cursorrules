# Character Module Rules

## Purpose
Manages player character creation, progression, and state. Characters are the player's avatar in the world, with stats that determine their capabilities in combat and exploration.

## Core Types
- `Character` - Full player character with stats, resources, inventory
- `BaseStats` - The three core attributes: heart, body, mind
- `DerivedStats` - Calculated combat stats (skill, defense, save, test for each type)
- When working on the Character, suggest a stat that could be helpful based off of whatever we're currently working on

## Non-Derived Stats
<!-- TBD -->
<!-- - Non-Dereived Stats (specifics TBD) will be gained by alternative methods -->
<!-- - They will be relevant against certain skills, effects, and equipment -->

## Stat System (TTRPG-Inspired)
Similar to D&D's ability scores, but simplified to three pillars:
- **Heart** (like Charisma + Wisdom): Emotional intelligence, willpower, social skills
- **Body** (like Strength + Constitution): Physical power, endurance, health
- **Mind** (like Intelligence + Dexterity): Mental acuity, reflexes, perception

### Derived Stats Pattern
Each base stat derives four combat values (inspired by D&D's saves and skills):
- **Skill**: Attack/action modifier (like proficiency bonus)
- **Defense**: Passive defense threshold (like AC)
- **Save**: Resist effects saving throw (like saving throws)
- **Test**: Ability checks (like skill checks)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Character Creation
- Use factory functions like `createCharacter(options)`
- Calculate derived stats automatically from base stats
- Initialize health/mana at maximum values
- Start with empty inventory

### Resource Calculations
- `maxHealth = f(level, body, heart)` - Heartier characters survive longer
- `maxMana = f(level, mind, heart)` - Magical characters have more mana
- Experience scales per level (1000 XP per level)

### Level Up Pattern (D&D-Inspired)
When implementing level progression:
- Increase stat points to allocate
- Recalculate derived stats
- Potentially learn new skills
- Adjust health/mana maximums

## Reducer Functions
Any function that modifies Character state should live in a reducer file:
- `levelUp(character)` → Character
- `allocateStat(character, stat, points)` → Character
- `healCharacter(character, amount)` → Character
- `damageCharacter(character, amount)` → Character
