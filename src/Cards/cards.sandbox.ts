/**
 * Sandbox card registry — the deck-forge experimentation surface.
 *
 * A module-level mutable registry that lets balance loops (the `/deck-tuning`
 * skill, the playtest CLI) trial NEW experimental cards and numeric OVERRIDES
 * of library cards without touching `cards.library.ts`. The library's
 * `getCardById` consults this registry FIRST, so a registered sandbox card is
 * live everywhere cards are looked up — deck building, `toCombatCard`
 * projection, and skill execution — with zero engine changes.
 *
 * Doctrine: status effects are the MAIN fun and the EFFICIENT path to dropping
 * enemy HP. The sandbox exists so new status-applying cards can be A/B-tested
 * against the sim before a literal is promoted into the library.
 *
 * Cycle safety: this module imports ONLY types from './types'. The library
 * binds its own base lookup here at module init via `bindSandboxLibraryGuard`
 * (collision checks + override merging both need it), so there is no import
 * cycle between the sandbox and `cards.library.ts`.
