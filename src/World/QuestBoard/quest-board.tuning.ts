/**
 * Quest Board minigame — tuning constants.
 *
 * One file so the balance loop has a single dial panel. Targets
 * (decided 2026-06-12): one full play of `build-the-boat` lands in
 * 5–10 minutes — roughly 3 laps of a 16-space loop, ~14 rolls,
 * ~5 in-game days. The quest cannot be failed; these dials shape how
 * EXPENSIVE a sloppy run feels and where the outcome tiers cut.
