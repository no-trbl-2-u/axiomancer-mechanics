/**
 * Hazard-Pattern Combat — AUTHORED THREAT SEQUENCES (the learnable enemy patterns).

 * GENERATED CONTENT. One entry per enemy: a deterministic, fully-revealed-up-front
 * sequence of phases the player learns and out-plays. Each phase declares its
 * hidden STANCE (the RPS read), a thematic `stanceHint` that implies but never
 * names that stance, RELATIVE dot/control factors (which track the enemy is weak
 * to — both win paths stay live across the roster), a telegraphed threat action
 * (`actionText` + optional debuff), and a `damageWeight`. The resolver in
 * `combat.threat.ts` computes the concrete thresholds + threat damage from level +
 * difficulty, so the whole roster retunes from a few constants.
 *
 * Authoring convention & catalog: see the `/combat-tuning` workflow. Edits here
