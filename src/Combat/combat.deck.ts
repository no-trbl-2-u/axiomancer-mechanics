/**
 * Spec 25 — Hazard-Pattern Combat: card deck (§4.3, §8).
 *
 * Mirrors the Hazard deck-management pattern (`src/World/Hazard/hazard.engine`
 * `drawFromPile` / `refillPile`): Fisher-Yates shuffle, draw-up-to-N, and
 * reshuffle-the-discard when the draw pile runs dry. The Hazard engine threads
 * its own `HazardRngState`; combat threads the seedable global RNG singleton so
 * dice, deck, and skill procs share one reproducible stream (hermetic via
 * `mockFixedRng` / `setSeed`).
 *
 * The player's combat deck is built from their learned skills (§4.3). A small
 * baseline of synthetic cards (Retreat) is always present so a player can leave
 * a fight even with no offensive skills learned.
