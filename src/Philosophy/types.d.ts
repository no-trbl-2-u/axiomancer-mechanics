/**
 * Philosophical alignment — three-axis cube (Phase 42).
 *
 * The system encodes a character's philosophical position on three
 * orthogonal axes drawn from `PhilosAxiosDoc.pdf`:
 *
 *   epistemology  — how truth is known           (Faith ↔ Agnostic ↔ Logic)
 *   outlook       — disposition toward existence (Pessimistic ↔ Neutral ↔ Optimistic)
 *   scope         — focus of meaning             (Individual ↔ Relational ↔ Transcendent)
 *
 * Each axis is an integer in `[-100, +100]`. The current `(low|mid|high)`
 * bucket triple at thresholds `±34` indexes one of 27 cells in
 * `philosophicalAlignment.library`. The system is orthogonal to
 * `moralMeter` — see `docs/philosophy.md`.
