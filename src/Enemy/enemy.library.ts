/**
 * Enemy library — Spec 07 content drop.
 *
 * Per the Spec 07 Q8 split: 3 simple, 6 normal, 3 elite, 2 boss, 1 unique =
 * 15 enemies total. Stat affinities (heart / body / mind) are distributed
 * across each difficulty tier so the encounter generator can offer variety
 * regardless of which stance the player favours.
 *
 * Authoring notes:
 *   - `tier1Overrides` mirrors the canonical Spec 03 Tier 1 buffs / debuffs
 *     so every enemy participates in the stance-effect economy. Variant
 *     procOverrides on elites / bosses give them flavour without rewriting
 *     the global proc table.
 *   - `procUnlocks` bumps the tier cap for elite (T2) and boss (T3) enemies
 *     so their proc rolls reach higher-tier candidates per Spec 03.
 *   - Loot tables follow Spec 07 Q7B — weighted entries with explicit `null`
 *     buckets for "nothing drops".
 *   - `xpReward` is left implicit on most enemies: `createEnemy` falls back
 *     to `level × DEFAULT_XP_BY_DIFFICULTY[difficulty]`. Authors override
 *     only when an enemy should grant unusual XP for narrative reasons.
