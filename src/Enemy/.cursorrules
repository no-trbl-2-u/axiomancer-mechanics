# Enemy Module Rules

## Purpose
Defines enemy characters, their AI behavior type, and encounter design. Enemies should feel dangerous but fair, with distinct personalities reflected in their combat logic.

## Enemy Design Philosophy During Player Childhood (Kingdom Hearts-Inspired)
- Enemies should be childish
- Enemy names should be puns
- Combat is safe - even `boss` enemyTier enemies should be easy

## Enemy Design Philosophy During Player Adulthood (Mörk Borg-Inspired)
- Enemies should be memorable and flavorful
- Combat is dangerous - even "weak" `normal` enemies can kill
- Descriptions should evoke feelings of dread, fear, disgust,

## Enemy Tiers
Tier system creates clear power progression:
- **Simple**: Easy encounters, beatable without difficulty
- **Normal**: Standard encounters, beatable by average party
- **Elite**: Tougher enemies, require strategy or good rolls
- **Boss**: Major encounters, unique abilities, high stakes
- **Unique**: Can range from easier than simple to harder than a boss

## Enemy Stats (Simplified from Player)
Enemies don't have base stats, only derived combat values:
- `maxHealth` / `maxMana`: Resource pools
- `physicalSkill` / `physicalDefense`: Body-type combat
- `mentalSkill` / `mentalDefense`: Mind-type combat
- `emotionalSkill` / `emotionalDefense`: Heart-type combat

## AI Logic Types
Enemy behavior patterns for decision-making:
- **Random**: Unpredictable, chaotic fighters
- **Aggressive**: Prioritize attack actions, target weakest
- **Defensive**: Prioritize defense, counterattack
- **Balanced**: Mix of offense and defense

### Future Logic Types (Game Theory-Inspired)
Consider adding:
- **Adaptive**: Learn from player patterns (tit-for-tat)
- **Exploitative**: Target player's weak stat type
- **Mimicking**: Copy player's last action type

## Implementation Guidelines

### Enemy Creation
```typescript
const enemy: Enemy = {
    id: 'goblin-scout',
    name: 'Goblin Scout',
    level: 2,
    health: 15,
    mana: 5,
    enemyStats: { ... },
    mapLocation: { name: 'fishing-village' },
    enemyTier: 'normal',
    description: 'A sneaky creature with beady eyes...',
    logic: 'aggressive'
};
```

### Map Location Association
Enemies should be tied to specific maps/areas, enabling:
- Region-appropriate encounters
- Difficulty scaling by area
- Thematic consistency

## File Organization
- `index.ts` - Enemy state management
- `enemy.library.ts` - Predefined enemy definitions
- `enemy.logic.ts` - AI decision-making functions
- `types.d.ts` - Enemy and EnemyStats types
- `enemys.mock.ts` - Test fixtures

## Encounter Design Tips
- Vary enemy types within an area
- Mix AI logic for interesting battles
- Consider enemy "tells" that hint at their type preference
- Boss enemies should have multiple phases or special abilities
