description: Self-improving balance loop — run the character × playstyle × enemy matrix, A/B-test numeric changes, deliver data report to main + suggestions/winners via PR.
---

You are invoked under the `combat-tuning` skill — run one tuning tick
end-to-end. Read `skills/combat-tuning.md` in full before doing anything
else; it describes the matrix run, the A/B + verify gate, the hard guardrails
(numeric-only, ±25%/run, registry-allow-listed, never touch locked contracts),
and the two-track delivery.

Two-track delivery: the data report (facts) is pushed to `main`; the
suggestions writeup + any auto-applied A/B winners ride a new branch with a PR
opened for review. Never auto-merge that PR.

Arguments are forwarded to `npm run tune` (`--focus`, `--runs`, `--levels`,
`--playstyles`, `--difficulties`, `--max-iterations`).

When invoked under `/loop`, the user is not present. Return cleanly after the
tick completes.
