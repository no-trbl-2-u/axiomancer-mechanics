# Spec 09 — Game Loop Orchestration

## Goal

A single `gameReducer(state, action): GameState` that handles every top-level
state transition: starting combat, resolving combat rounds, processing nodes,
saving / loading, and applying inter-system events. Plus a `game.cli.ts`
that demonstrates the full loop end-to-end.

**Success state:** From character creation → exploring nodes → combat →
return to map → level up → quest progress → save / load → all driven by
`gameReducer` and re-renderable from the saved state.

## Why now / dependencies

- **Unblocks:** the React Native consumer (Spec 12), Phase 9 content work.
- **Depends on:** Specs 02, 06, 07, 08. Sketchable earlier; only fully
  implementable after those.

## Current state

- **Spec 08 landed** — pure `moveToNode`, `processNode`,
  `applyDialogueChoice`, quest log, map registry, etc. (see
  `docs/world.md`). Consumers can import and compose these
  **outside** the package store today.
- `Game/store.ts` is still a Zustand vanilla store scoped to
  combat, inventory, equipment, and `save()` — **no** world-move
  or `processNode` actions on `GameStore` yet.
- `Game/game.reducer.ts` is intentionally minimal — only `createNewGameState`
  and `GAME_STATE_VERSION`.
- `actions.constants.ts` exports `COMBAT_ACTION` constants (attack, defend,
  skill, item, flee, back).
- No `gameReducer`, no top-level dispatch.
- `combat.cli.ts` has its own bespoke main loop calling
  `store.getState().updateCombat(...)` after each round.
- `character.cli.ts` is a one-shot character builder.

## Open questions

1. **Reducer vs. store.** Two coexisting models today:
   - Pure reducers (`combat.reducer.ts`, `world.reducer.ts`, `item.reducer.ts`).
   - Zustand store with inlined logic.
   Decide:
   - (A) `gameReducer` is the single source of truth; the store calls into
     it, and is mostly a Zustand wrapper for subscribers.
   - (B) The store keeps its inlined actions; `gameReducer` is only used by
     non-Zustand consumers.
   - (C) Drop Zustand from this package entirely (Spec 12).
   > Your answer: B, except let's fully switch to zustand instead of it bring a wrapper.

2. **Action shape.** Tagged union (`{ type: 'START_COMBAT', payload }`) vs
   sub-action records (`{ kind: 'combat'; combat: CombatAction }`).
   > Your answer: First one

3. **Save format versioning.** `GAME_STATE_VERSION` exists. When the schema
   changes, do you:
   - (A) Refuse to load older versions.
   - (B) Migrate via `migrate(state, fromVersion, toVersion)`.
   > Your answer: B

4. **Save granularity.** Save on every action (autosave), only on map
   transitions, only when the player explicitly saves?
   > Your answer: Autosave but leave a comment near the main logic that we'll revisit this  if the game seems too brutal
   > **DONE at Phase 51 (`4972f9a`).** Path B picked: autosave is restricted to a curated `DURABLE_ACTIONS` allowlist (`COMBAT_ROUND`, `LEVEL_UP`, `END_COMBAT`, `MOVE_TO_NODE`, `APPLY_DIALOGUE`, `SAVE_GAME`). UI-tier actions never write through. Implementation in `src/Game/store.ts` (DURABLE_ACTIONS + gated dispatch save). Hermetic coverage in `src/Game/e2e/autosave-throttling.engine.test.ts`. The two `TODO(spec-09)` markers in `store.ts` + `game.reducer.ts` are drained.

5. **Persistence transport.** `nullAdapter` and `node.adapter.ts` exist.
   The React Native app needs an `AsyncStorage` adapter. Should this
   package ship one, or document the interface and let the consumer
   provide it?
   > Your answer: I don't know. Whatever one keeps both parts' responsibilities separate.

6. **Event surface for UI.** When the engine performs combat / level-up /
   quest progress, how do consumers learn about it?
   - (A) Read `state.log` or computed selectors.
   - (B) `gameReducer` returns `{ state, events: GameEvent[] }`.
   - (C) Event emitter / observable.
   See Spec 12 for the broader question.
   > Your answer: C

7. **`game.cli.ts` shape.** The main CLI wires:
   - Title / load-or-new.
   - Map view (list nodes, choose to move).
   - Combat (delegates to existing `combat.cli` flow but driven by
     `gameReducer`).
   - Inventory / character screens.
   Anything missing?
   > Your answer: There'll be a "Journal" tab as well that keeps track of main and side quests, as well as, current "philosophy/alignment". There'll also be "Skills" to keep track of unlocked skills. The CLI is only a way to test changes so will eventually need this stuff.

## Proposed approach

1. **Action types** — define `GameAction` union per Q2.
2. **`gameReducer(state, action)`** — switch over action type, delegating
   to the existing `combat.reducer` / `world.reducer` / `item.reducer`.
3. **Refactor `store.ts`** per Q1.
4. **Migrations** per Q3.
5. **Autosave hook** per Q4.
6. **Event surface** per Q6.
7. **`game.cli.ts`** end-to-end demo.
8. **Tests** — full transcript: new game → fight → win → level up → save
   → reload → state matches.

## Acceptance checklist

- [x] All 7 questions answered.
- [x] `gameReducer` exported and used by the CLI.
- [x] Save/load round-trip preserves combat, world, character, inventory.
- [x] `game.cli.ts` demonstrates the full loop.
- [x] `docs/` gets a new `gameloop.md` (or appendix in `docs/character.md`).

## Out of scope

- React Native UI consumer — that's a separate repo. Spec 12 covers the
  contract.
- Multiple save slots.
- Cloud sync.

## Post-spec engine extensions

Phases that extended the Game state shape, the `GameAction` union, or
the `gameReducer` dispatch table after Spec 09's v2 baseline. All
additions are additive on `GameState`; legacy saves continue to load
via the `migrate()` ladder in `src/Game/game.migrate.ts`.

### Phase 72 — Run-loop semantics (`resetRun` + `runId` + STARTING_REGION)

Closes GH#65 ask 2. Mobile BEGIN AGAIN's full-heal + dismiss band-aid
gets replaced with a proper engine primitive.

**Shape additions on `GameState`:**

```ts
interface GameState {
    version: number;
    runId: string;   // Phase 72 — required UUID-shaped id; bumped per resetRun
    // ... existing fields ...
}
```

**Action union extension:**

```ts
type GameAction = /* ... existing variants ... */
    | { type: 'RESET_RUN'; payload: { keepCharacter: boolean } };
```

**Store method:**

```ts
store.resetRun({ keepCharacter: boolean }): GameState
```

`keepCharacter: true` preserves the character ledger (player +
philosophicalAlignment + moralMeter + rngState; Phase 73 added codex
to this list), refills HP to maxHealth, clears `player.effects`
defensively, and resets run-scoped state (world via
`createStartingWorld()` → fishing-village starting node; combat;
quests; flags; observer cache). `keepCharacter: false` performs a
full new-game reset carrying only `rngState`. Every call assigns a
fresh `runId` via `generateRunId(() => getRng().random())`.

**Save format / migration:** `GAME_STATE_VERSION` bumped `5 → 6`;
`migrateV5toV6` defaults `runId` for legacy v5 saves. `RESET_RUN`
added to `DURABLE_ACTIONS` so the new state persists immediately.

**New public-surface exports** (in `src/Game/run-loop.ts`):
`generateRunId(rng: () => number): string` (16-char hex; Phase 35
character-id generation pattern; no `crypto` dependency for React
Native compatibility) + `STARTING_REGION: MapName = 'fishing-village'`
(canonical starting region; reuses `MapDefinition.startingNode` —
no new "hearth" type primitive). Fixture bump: +2 runtime exports.

Hermetic pin at `src/Game/e2e/run-loop.engine.test.ts` (8 cases —
preserve/reset matrix + migration + DURABLE_ACTIONS persistence).
See `docs/gameloop.md` § "Run-loop reset (Phase 72)".

### Phase 73 — Codex slice (`codex: CodexState` + `UNLOCK_CODEX_ENTRY` + auto-firing wire)

Closes GH#65 ask 3. Mobile `<CombatFriendshipPanel>` NEW ENTRY card
gets a typed surface to mount against.

**Shape additions on `GameState`:**

```ts
interface CodexState {
    unlockedEntries: string[];   // append-only; de-duped
}

interface GameState {
    version: number;
    runId: string;
    // ... existing fields ...
    codex: CodexState;   // Phase 73 — required slice; defaults [] on new games
}
```

Wrapper shape (not flat `string[]`) so future per-entry metadata
(unlock-timestamp, read-status) can land additive-optionally without
breaking the existing surface. Same pattern as `QuestLog`.

**Action union extension:**

```ts
type GameAction = /* ... existing variants ... */
    | { type: 'UNLOCK_CODEX_ENTRY'; payload: { entryId: string } };
```

**Store method:**

```ts
store.unlockCodexEntry(entryId: string): void
```

**Auto-firing wire:** the `END_COMBAT` reducer appends the
befriended enemy's `journalEntry.id` to `state.codex.unlockedEntries`
(de-duped) on `outcome === 'friendship'`. `store.endCombat()`
surfaces `{ id, title }` on
`CombatEndReport.friendshipReward.codexEntryUnlocked` only when the
entry wasn't already unlocked (mirrors the Phase 69 `alignmentShift`
surfacing pattern; body is recovered at consumer render time via
content-registry lookup against `Enemy.journalEntry` — see
`specs/07` § "Post-spec engine extensions" Phase 73 block for the
per-foe content shape **and author coverage**).

**Cross-phase coupling with Phase 72:** the `RESET_RUN`
`keepCharacter: true` branch preserves `state.codex` — codex unlocks
are character knowledge that carries across runs alongside
`philosophicalAlignment` and `moralMeter`. `keepCharacter: false`
drops to `createNewGameState()` which initializes empty codex.

**Save format / migration:** `GAME_STATE_VERSION` bumped `6 → 7`;
`migrateV6toV7` defaults `codex = { unlockedEntries: [] }` for
legacy v6 saves. `UNLOCK_CODEX_ENTRY` added to `DURABLE_ACTIONS` so
unlocks persist immediately.

**New public-surface exports:** `CodexEntry` + `CodexState` types
(both on `src/index.ts`; `CodexEntry` re-exported through the Enemy
block since it travels on `Enemy.journalEntry`). Fixture bump: +2
type exports.

Hermetic pin at `src/Game/e2e/codex.engine.test.ts` (6 cases —
empty default + friendship unlocks + de-dupe + no-journalEntry no-op
+ victory-outcome no-op + migration). See `docs/gameloop.md` and
`docs/api.md` § "Codex slice (Phase 73)" for the consumer-facing
surface.
