# Spec 02 — Combat Round Resolver

## Goal

Promote the pure round resolver in `src/Combat/e2e/combat.engine.ts`
(`resolveCombatTurn`) into a first-class part of the combat module so any
client (the CLI, the future React Native UI, the automated tester) drives a
round through one entry point. Today the resolver exists for tests but the CLI
still owns its own parallel inline copy of the same flow.

**Success state:** `combat.cli.ts` contains UI / IO concerns only, and one call
to the resolver advances state by one round. The resolver is exported from
`src/Combat/index.ts` (and `src/index.ts`), and its behaviour is locked down by
the existing hermetic e2e suite plus any new cases this spec adds. Seedable
RNG is *not* part of this spec — it lives in Spec 11.

## Why now / dependencies

- **Unblocks:** Spec 03 (T2/T3 procs need a single resolution site to plug into),
  Spec 04 (skills replace `attack` in the action pipeline), Spec 11 (assertion
  layer needs a deterministic round function), Spec 12 (UI consumers can drive
  state transitions without re-implementing the math).
- **Depends on:** Spec 01 — **landed**. `processRoundStartEffects`,
  `processRoundEndEffects`, `canAct`, `getActiveEffectModifiers`,
  `getEffectiveStats`, `resolveEffectiveAdvantage` and the cleanse / dispel /
  drain / mana-regen helpers are all in `src/Combat/` and consumed by the
  existing engine + CLI code.

## Current state

- A pure resolver already exists: `resolveCombatTurn(state, playerAction,
  enemyAction): CombatState` at `src/Combat/e2e/combat.engine.ts`. It is the
  authoritative source covered by the hermetic e2e suite
  (`src/Combat/e2e/combat.engine.test.ts`).
- The function is **not** exported from `src/Combat/index.ts` or
  `src/index.ts`; only the test file imports it.
- `combat.cli.ts` still owns a parallel async copy of the same flow
  (`runCombatTurn`) that interleaves `console.log` / `inquirer` / `delay`
  with the math. The two implementations have to be kept in sync by hand.
- `combat.reducer.ts` still exposes only state-shape mutations (`setPhase`,
  `setPlayerStance`, `setPlayerAction`, `appendLog`, `incrementFriendship`,
  `endCombat`). It does **not** host the resolver today.
- Naming inconsistency: the spec was originally written around
  `resolveCombatRound`, but the function in code is `resolveCombatTurn`.
  Picking one name (and aliasing the other) is part of this spec.

## Open questions

> Note: questions marked **(de-facto answer in code)** already have a working
> implementation in `combat.engine.ts` / `combat.cli.ts`. Confirm or override —
> a confirmation locks the choice in; an override re-opens the work.

1. **Roll model.** **(de-facto answer: C — hybrid.)** Today
   `resolveAttackVsAttack` uses attack-vs-attack with the higher total winning,
   while `resolvePlayerAttackEnemyDefend` / `resolvePlayerDefendEnemyAttack`
   route the defender's roll through `getDefenseStat × DEFENSE_MULTIPLIERS[adv]`
   instead of contesting attacks. Options:
   - (A) Single-contest model everywhere.
   - (B) D&D-style — defender always rolls, regardless of action.
   - (C) **(current)** Hybrid: attack-vs-attack when both attack;
     attack-vs-defense when one defends.
   > Your answer: Whatever option maintains the rock/paper/scissors format.

2. **Damage formula.** **(de-facto answer: A — keep as-is.)** Today
   `damageRoll = die(attackerAdv) + attackerStat + rollMod`, then
   `calculateFinalDamage(damageRoll, baseDefense × multiplier, ...)`. Options:
   - (A) **(current)** Keep as-is.
   - (B) Introduce a separate "weapon damage" die (rolled once per action),
     stat scales as a flat add.
   - (C) `damage = attackRoll − defenseRoll`, no second roll.
   > Your answer: A or B. Whichever you think is more scalable. (ie. imagine what combat would looke like with entities 20 levels higher)

3. **Defense base asymmetry.** Still present in code: when the player defends,
   defense uses `getBaseStat(player, stance) + defenseDelta`; when the enemy
   defends, it uses `getDefenseStat(enemy, stance)` (derived). Bug or
   intentional? Resolving this is a prerequisite for symmetric balancing.
   > Your answer: That is likely a bug. I want symmetric balancing.

4. **Initiative.** Today both combatants act simultaneously. Options:
   - (A) Keep simultaneous.
   - (B) Add `rollInitiative(combatant)` and resolve sequentially. Use luck or
     mind as tiebreaker.
   - (C) Simultaneous attacks resolve simultaneously, but skill / item actions
     happen before basic attacks.
   > Your answer: A. I want to maintain the rock/paper/scissors format. When skills/items are involved, they will happen at specific phases of combat instead.

5. **Lethality.** With the friendship mechanic and regen effects, the current
   tone leans forgiving; the Mörk Borg inspiration suggests swingy lethality.
   Picking a target average rounds-to-resolution helps with balance:
   - 3-5 rounds (Mörk-Borg-y, swingy)
   - 6-10 rounds (mid-weight)
   - 10+ rounds (drawn-out, attrition)
   > Your answer: I want this type of lethality to be a sliding scale as the user plays. During specific "Ethical dilemmas", if they make sacrifices for the "greater good" the game becomes increasingly lethal. (ie. Selfishness is rewarded with an easier experience and vice-versa). Keep that in mind when making all future difficulty decisions

6. **What the resolver returns.** **(de-facto answer: state-only.)** Today
   `resolveCombatTurn` returns just `CombatState`; the CLI prints inline,
   nothing is logged. Options:
   - (A) **(current)** Return state only — UI / CLI compute their own
     rendering from the diff.
   - (B) Return `{ state, events: RoundEvent[] }` where `events` is a typed
     event stream the UI can consume (this is also Spec 12 Q5).
   > Your answer: B except name it "combatEvents". Make sure the RoundEvent is organized by phases though. 

7. **`canAct` failure path.** **(de-facto answer: hybrid B/C — round
   advances; CLI surfaces the reason; the chosen action is mapped to
   `'skip'` during resolution.)** Today the CLI prompts for stance/action,
   then calls `canAct(effects, requestedStance)`; if the result is
   `canAct: false`, the action becomes `'skip'` and `printTurnSkipped` /
   `printForcedStance` renders the reason. Options:
   - (A) Round advances; player's action is silently no-op.
   - (B) Round advances; CLI displays the reason instead of the choice prompt.
   - (C) **(current)** Player still chooses; the chosen action is replaced
     with `'skip'` once resolution starts, and the reason is rendered.
   > Your answer: C

8. **Resolver naming + location.** Pick the canonical name and home:
   - (A) Rename `resolveCombatTurn` → `resolveCombatRound`, move it to
     `src/Combat/combat.reducer.ts`, alias the old name for back-compat.
   - (B) Keep `resolveCombatTurn`, lift it from `src/Combat/e2e/` to
     `src/Combat/` (engine logic should not live under `e2e/`).
   - (C) Keep both files; export `resolveCombatTurn` from `src/Combat/index.ts`
     where it currently lives.
   > Your answer: Hybrid A/B. Rename to "resolveCombatRound", no alias, lift it. I originally thought "combat.engine.ts" was only for the e2e testing. If it makes more sense to lift that entire module, move all of it out of e2e. I'll leave that decision to you.

## Proposed approach

1. **Pick the resolver's canonical name + home (Q8)** and move the existing
   `resolveCombatTurn` accordingly. Export it from `src/Combat/index.ts` and
   re-export from `src/index.ts`. Leave the e2e test file pointed at the new
   path.
2. **Unify the CLI's `runCombatTurn` with the engine.** Replace the inline
   math in `combat.cli.ts` with calls to the resolver, keeping only the
   prompt / render / delay scaffolding. The display module
   (`combat.display.ts`) is the right place for any new "render this slice
   of the round" helpers; the resolver should not log.
3. **(Optional) Resolve Q3.** If the answer flips the player-defense path
   from base to derived, update `resolvePlayerDefendEnemyAttack` and the
   sibling helper in the engine; add a regression test asserting the
   symmetric outcome.
4. **(Optional) Initiative (Q4)** — only if (B) or (C). Add
   `rollInitiative(combatant)` and `determineTurnOrder` and route through
   the resolver.
5. **(Optional) Event stream (Q6 → B)** — only if Q6 flips. Define
   `RoundEvent` union, change the resolver to return `{ state, events }`,
   port the CLI rendering to consume events. Coordinate with Spec 12 Q5.
6. **Tests:**
   - Extend `combat.engine.test.ts` to cover any new branches introduced
     (initiative, stun-only round, forced-stance round, blocked-stance
     round). Use `mockAlternatingRng` / `mockFixedRng` from
     `src/test-utils/rng.ts`.
   - Add a regression assertion that the CLI loop and the engine produce
     the same final `CombatState` for a fixed action script (no engine /
     CLI drift).

## Acceptance checklist

- [x] Q3, Q4, Q5, Q8 answered. Q1, Q2, Q6, Q7 either confirmed (lock the
      current behaviour) or overridden (open a sub-task).
- [x] Resolver exported from `src/Combat/index.ts` and `src/index.ts` under
      the name picked in Q8.
- [x] `combat.cli.ts` `runCombatTurn` delegates to the resolver — no inline
      attack / damage math remains.
- [x] Hermetic e2e suite under `src/Combat/e2e/` covers the same win
      conditions plus any new branches added by this spec; `npm test` and
      `npm run type-check` clean.
- [x] `npm run auto:combat -- 20` produces stable logs without crashes.
- [x] `docs/combat.md` "Pending (Phase 2)" section reflects reality;
      resolver is in the API table.

## Implementation notes (landed)

- **Q8 resolution.** Renamed `resolveCombatTurn` → `resolveCombatRound`,
  no alias. Lifted out of `src/Combat/e2e/` into a new file
  `src/Combat/combat.resolver.ts` (a new `*.resolver.ts` file convention,
  documented in `.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/testing.md`, and the
  hermetic-e2e `.mdc` rule). Folding it into `combat.reducer.ts` per
  option A would have crushed a 590-line orchestrator that returns
  `{ state, events }` into a file currently containing only trivial
  state-shape mutations — different conceptual layers. The `*.resolver.ts`
  convention also matches the in-file naming of every sub-resolver
  (`resolveAttackVsAttack`, `resolvePlayerAttackEnemyDefend`,
  `resolveAttackHit`, etc.).
- **Q6 (event stream).** `RoundResolution = { state, combatEvents }`. Events
  are organised by `phase` (`round-start` → `action-restriction` →
  `advantage` → `stance-effects` → `scenario` → `round-end`); the typed
  `RoundEvent` union and per-phase sub-unions are exported from
  `src/Combat/index.ts` and `src/index.ts`.
- **Q3 (defense symmetry).** Both player- and enemy-defend paths now route
  through `getDefenseStat`. The asymmetric "player uses base + defenseDelta,
  enemy uses derived" gap is closed.
- **CLI delegation.** `combat.cli.ts` now contains UI only: prompt → call
  `resolveCombatRound` → `renderRoundEvents` from `combat.display.ts`.
  All inline `resolveAttackVsAttack` / `resolvePlayerAttackEnemyDefend`
  / `resolvePlayerDefendEnemyAttack` math has been removed from the CLI.
- **UX shift.** Round-start ticks (regen / poison / etc.) now display
  *after* the player's prompt rather than before, because the resolver
  runs them inside the same single call. Acceptable per the
  "single-call resolver" architecture goal of this spec.
- **Tests.** Existing e2e suites (`combat.resolver.test.ts`,
  `effects.engine.test.ts`) updated to drive `resolveCombatRound`
  through its `{ state, combatEvents }` return shape. 132/132 tests
  green twice in a row; `npm run type-check` clean;
  `npm run auto:combat -- 20` finishes 20/20 sessions with exit code 0
  and zero error patterns in the log.
