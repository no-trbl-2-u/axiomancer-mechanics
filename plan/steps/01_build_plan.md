# 01 — Build plan

> Style guardrails for every phase below. Always ship unit tests
> alongside code — never "add tests later". Every implementation
> lands with at least one hermetic e2e test (`*.engine.test.ts`).
> One commit per logical unit of work; only when
> `npm run type-check` and `npm test` are green for that increment.
> CLI files contain UI only — logic goes in resolver/reducer modules.

## Status (at-a-glance)

`/march`, `/ship-a-phase`, and (transitively) `/loop` read this
block to find the next phase. Format: `[ ]` pending → `[x]`
shipped (with commit hash).

**Already shipped (pre-loop, prior history):**
- [x] Spec 01 — Effects engine: DoTs, stat mods, action restrictions (pre-loop)
- [x] Spec 02 — Combat round resolver (`resolveCombatRound`) (pre-loop)
- [x] Spec 03 — Tier 2/3 effect procs (Stance × action tables) (pre-loop)
- [x] Spec 04 — Skills engine (types + engine, no content) (pre-loop)
- [x] Spec 04b — Skills library: 12 early-game skills + hermetic e2e (pre-loop)
- [x] Spec 05 — Equipment engine (types + engine, no content) (pre-loop)
- [x] Spec 05b — Equipment library: 50 pieces + 12 consumables (pre-loop)
- [x] Spec 05c — Item rarity (pre-loop)
- [x] Spec 05d — Modifier catalogue (pre-loop)
- [x] Spec 05e — Set items (pre-loop)
- [x] Spec 06 — Character progression (XP, levelling, skill learning) (pre-loop)
- [x] Spec 07 — Enemy content and AI (pre-loop)
- [x] Spec 08 — World content and hazards (pre-loop)

**Next up (autonomous loop's queue):**
- [ ] Phase 09 — Game loop orchestration (`gameReducer`, full store wiring, `game.cli.ts`)
- [ ] Phase 10 — Moral/difficulty meter (choice tracking, alignment, difficulty scaling)
- [ ] Phase 11 — RNG seeding and test harness (seeded RNG, deterministic replays, full test harness)
- [ ] Phase 12 — Package architecture and events (event surface, React Native adapter docs, clean barrel)
- [ ] Phase 13 — ESLint fix (repair `eslint.config.mts`, add `@typescript-eslint` plugin correctly)
- [ ] Phase 14 — Story content foundation (NPC types + first named NPC with moral dialogue)

> **After phase 14:** the loop transitions to `/iterate` —
> spec gap filling, test coverage improvements, doc updates,
> and ongoing audits. `/march` makes that transition automatic.

> **Deploy gate note:** `npm run deploy:check` runs `npm pack --dry-run`.
> This requires `dist/` (from `npm run build`). Always run `verify` first.

## Per-phase scope

### Phase 09 — Game loop orchestration

Implement `gameReducer(state, action): GameState` as the single top-level
dispatch; switch `store.ts` to use it as primary. Ship `game.cli.ts` that
demonstrates the full loop (character creation → explore → combat → level
up → save → load). Full hermetic e2e transcript test. See
`specs/09-game-loop-orchestration.md` and `plan/phases/phase_09_game_loop_orchestration.md`.

### Phase 10 — Moral/difficulty meter

Track player choices across `GameAction` dispatches. A
`MoralDifficulty` score (or alignment tuple) floats based on merciful/
aggressive choices, dialogue picks, and quest resolutions. Ties into
`processNode` events and enemy AI aggression scaling. See
`specs/10-moral-difficulty-meter.md`.

### Phase 11 — RNG seeding and test harness

Seeded, resettable RNG singleton (`src/rng/`); expose in `src/index.ts`.
Deterministic replay harness that captures a game transcript and verifies
it replays identically from seed. Retrofit existing `test-utils/rng.ts`
stubs to use the seeded singleton. See `specs/11-rng-seeding-and-test-harness.md`.

### Phase 12 — Package architecture and events

Define the event surface (`GameEvent[]` or observable) for UI consumers.
Document the `PersistenceAdapter` interface for React Native `AsyncStorage`.
Audit and tighten `src/index.ts` barrel — remove leaky internals. Add
package.json `exports` map. See `specs/12-package-architecture-and-events.md`.

### Phase 13 — ESLint fix

Fix `eslint.config.mts` to correctly register `@typescript-eslint` plugin.
Make `npm run lint` green. Add `lint` back into the verify gate. Tracked as
a known broken item since project start.

### Phase 14 — Story content foundation

First named NPC with a moral dialogue tree. Implement `NPC` entity with
branching dialogue that affects the moral/difficulty meter. Tie into
`processNode` dialogue flow. See `specs/story/` for content direction.

---

## Carry-overs / known gaps

- ESLint is broken (Phase 13 addresses this).
- `store.ts` has no `moveToNode` / `processNode` actions yet (Phase 09).
- No `gameReducer` dispatch exists yet (Phase 09).
