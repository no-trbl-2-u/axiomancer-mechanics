<!-- Pass 79 (2026-06-24 at commit b97ea30): 0 candidates proposed. Dispatched from /march→/iterate failure mode 3 (zero findings ≥3.0; bold posture bypasses rate-limit; 10 commits since pass 78 at 5be67d6 — rate-limit not met, but bold-posture bypass applies per prior pass precedent). Full signal-source walk (§4): **AUDIT.md Pending** 1 row — `[needs-user-call — DIV-MECH-005]` (game.cli.ts map-encounter routing decision needed), already covered by the DIV-MECH-005 walkthrough candidate in ## Pending; NOT a new phase candidate. **CRITIQUE.md Pending** all `[x]` (fully drained — critique-87 LOWs fully resolved across this window). **Knowledge-Gaps.md** only Q28 deferred (endgame multiple-endings, content-authoring — no engine work planned). **specs/** all recommended-order DONE; Specs 26-30 reassessment candidate standing in ## Pending (stale — Pressure-Track model removed; awaiting /oversight to retire/replace). **braindump/** all 3 entries implemented or superseded (BRAINDUMP.md; rarity-modifiers-set-items; 2026-06-21-hazard-pattern-combat — Option C shipped as Spec 25). **spec.md 6-month horizon** unchanged (named NPCs / enemy families / continent 2 [deferred] — content-authoring, not engine gaps). **Recent commits** (10 since pass 78): entirely iterate/docs/fix work — critique-87 LOW-2 sub-barrel cleanup (2027028), resolveCardDieCost doc gap (b97553a), DIV-MECH-005 loop tracking (c74e543), Spec 26b threat exports (efb0d54). No fix-cluster rework pattern; no new public exports; no phase-tier signal. **Iterate audit findings this tick (all below 3.0)**: [D] `stanceBeats` in `src/Combat/index.ts` has zero external consumers (not in root barrel; only `combat.engine.ts` callers) — score 3 × 8 / 10 = 2.4, below 2.5 filing threshold; will drain as next iterate tick; [E] tuning/config constants (`COMBAT_DICE_COUNT`, `COMBAT_HAND_SIZE`, `COMBAT_DIE_FACES`, `STATUS_RESOLUTION_*`, `STATUS_ENGAGEMENT_FLOOR_PERCENT`, `PASSIVE_DEFENSE_MULTIPLIER`, `SYNTHETIC_CARD_IDS`, `AFFIXES_PER_RARITY`) in public barrel but absent from `spec.md`/`bearings.md` contracts — score 2 × 9 / 10 = 1.8, below 2.5 filing threshold; G: `@types/node` 25→26 major bump (T approval required — skip). **Stale candidate re-confirmation for /oversight** (flagged in pass 78, still unretired): (A) "PR #190 Press Fate + Deck Presets — e2e convention gap" — STALE/RESOLVED (35013a6 + 35cd2bc + ba19c41 drained all 3 issues); (B) "Minor dependency patch bumps" — STALE (three targets shipped at 725d28f; `@types/node` major-bump remains, T approval required); (C) "Public-surface guard follows `export *` re-exports" — STALE/RESOLVED (e66c2d4 shipped the fix; AUDIT Done confirms).

No fix-cluster rework pattern; no new public exports. **Stale candidate flags for /oversight**: (A) Candidate "PR #190 Press Fate + Deck Presets — e2e convention gap" (line 94) — **STALE/RESOLVED**: all three issues described (re-roll helper zero tests → 35013a6; deck-presets off e2e convention → 35cd2bc; helpers not barrel-exported → ba19c41) are fully drained in this window; /oversight should retire this row. (B) Candidate "Minor dependency patch bumps" (line 126) — **STALE**: the three targets (`@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` 8.62.0, `typescript-eslint` 8.62.0, `globals` 17.7.0) all shipped at 725d28f; only `@types/node` 25→26 major bump remains (T approval required); /oversight to retire or rescope.

NONE of these are directly implementable against the live HP-only engine.

### Candidate: DIV-MECH-005 fishing-village walkthrough → Hazard-Pattern Combat
- signal: **CRITIQUE.md Pending** LOW-3 (critique-87, commit 9b6e037) — `divergences.md` DIV-MECH-005 (lines 86-98) states "Phase 165 shipped (DIV-MECH-001 resolved). File a dedicated phase or iterate-tier task to update the fishing-village walkthrough to use `combat.cli.ts` for Hazard-Pattern Combat." No Pending row exists in CRITIQUE, AUDIT, or the build plan for this follow-up. Without a queued entry the follow-up will stale indefinitely across loop passes. Critique-87's score: 3 × 9 / 10 = 2.7 — at the ≥2.5 filing threshold; filed per aggressive-filing standing rule.
- scope: Update `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/fishing-village-exploration.json` (and `.goal.md`) to drive Hazard-Pattern Combat via `combat.cli.ts` (`npm run combat`) instead of legacy combat-tab defend rounds, for the encounter trigger at node `fv-15`. Update `src/Game/e2e/spec08.engine.test.ts` encounter-coverage comment to note Hazard-Pattern Combat is the live surface. Confirm `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/README.md` reflects the change. Doc + walkthrough JSON + one test comment; no engine source changes. Score qualifies as iterate-tier if scoped to files touched; the multi-file span (2 walkthrough files + 1 test comment + README) makes it a clean phase-or-iterate task.
- unblocks: Closes the DIV-MECH-005 divergence fully; ensures the fishing-village agentic walkthrough demonstrates the live Hazard-Pattern Combat CLI (Phase 165) rather than the dev-only legacy tab, aligning the canonical automation artefact with the shipped play surface. Removes the only remaining open divergence in `divergences.md`.
- blocked-by: None — Phase 165 (`combat.cli.ts`) shipped at `3ed4755`; walkthrough JSON authoring requires no engine changes.
- score: 3 × 9 / 10 = 2.7
- recommended-slot: next iterate tick (autonomous, multi-file but all automation/plan/test-comment scope)

### Candidate: PR #190 Press Fate + Deck Presets — e2e convention gap
- signal: **Recent commits** — PR #190 (commit 3337d32) shipped 8 new public exports: the partial Press Fate re-roll helpers (`rerollSpentDice`/`hasRerollableDice`/`dieIsRerollable` in `combat.dice.ts`) and the preset combat deck surface (`COMBAT_DECK_PRESETS`/`COMBAT_DECK_PRESET_ORDER`/`listDeckPresets`/`getDeckPreset`/`buildPresetDeck` in `combat.deck-presets.ts`). Front-door docs were added at 887e023 (AUDIT pass-111). However, the three re-roll helpers have **zero dedicated test coverage** — they are exercised only indirectly via `playSignatureSkill('sig-press-the-point')` at `hazard-pattern-combat.engine.test.ts:347`; no test directly asserts the helpers' semantics (which dice are rerollable, what `dieIsRerollable` returns per state, that `hasRerollableDice` returns false when all dice are available). The deck preset surface sits at a module-root `src/Combat/combat.deck-presets.test.ts` (off the `e2e/*.engine.test.ts` hermetic convention that every sibling Combat module follows). This is structurally identical to critique-77 LOW (equip-delta off-convention, drained at b2488a3).
- scope: Add `src/Combat/e2e/press-fate-deck-presets.engine.test.ts` covering: (a) `dieIsRerollable` — true for spent/exhausted/x-locked dice, false for available dice; (b) `hasRerollableDice` — false for an all-available pool, true when any spent/exhausted/x die is present; (c) `rerollSpentDice` — only targeted dice change, at-least-one-usable guard fires, empty-reroll case; (d) `buildPresetDeck`/`listDeckPresets` — each preset produces a non-empty deck containing Retreat, `getDeckPreset` round-trips, unknown id returns empty. Retire or absorb `src/Combat/combat.deck-presets.test.ts` into the new e2e file to restore single-location convention.
- unblocks: Restores the `e2e/*.engine.test.ts` hermetic convention for the PR #190 surface; makes the three re-roll helper semantics directly verifiable as public contract rather than inferred from signature-skill behaviour; adds a guard against future regressions in the deck-preset system.
- blocked-by: None — all target functions shipped and barrel-exported at 3337d32.
- score: 4 × 8 / 10 = 3.2
- recommended-slot: next iterate or dedicated test-cleanup phase; pairs naturally with any /combat-tuning tick that uses deck presets

### Candidate: Stale Spec 26-30 pool reassessment (OVERSIGHT-ATTENDED)
- signal: **Architectural staleness** — all five pass-75 Pending candidates (Specs 26–30, scores 5.6/3.6/4.2/4.2/4.0) were filed against the **two-Pressure-Track win model** (DoT Erosion + Control Saturation), which was **REMOVED at cb67ad3** (HP-only model, 2026-06-22). Spec 26 explicitly depends on `combat.pressure.ts` (deleted at cb67ad3), Spec 27 on pressure-track die minting, Spec 28 on track-fill mechanics, Spec 29 on "harden the raced track" intents, Spec 30 on `dotErosionReached` projection. Additionally, the "Public-surface guard follows `export *` re-exports" candidate (pass 74, 4.2) was flagged STALE/RESOLVED in pass 75 (fix shipped at e66c2d4) — still in Pending. **Six stale candidates need /oversight disposition before more combat-depth work is filed**.
- scope: At the next /oversight, T reviews the six stale Pending rows and decides per row: retire (move to Rejected with a note), replace with an HP-model-native successor spec filed as a new Pending candidate, or defer. The three HP-model-native candidates filed in this pass (candidates 2/3/4 below) are the suggested replacements for the highest-value Spec 26-30 ideas — but T must approve the pivot from the pressure-track framing. No code changes; plan files only.
- unblocks: Clears queue ambiguity so /march knows which combat-depth work is actually in scope. Without this, any attempt to autonomously ship Spec 26-30 would break against the deleted `combat.pressure.ts` / renamed constants.
- blocked-by: None for the housekeeping; requires T to attend the oversight.
- score: 8 × 9 / 10 = 7.2
- recommended-slot: immediate — needed before any combat-depth phase can be promoted

### Candidate: HP-model combat sim status-engagement metrics
- signal: **Recent commits** + **CRITIQUE.md Pending** (MED-1 through MED-3 all reference the HP-only model as a doc-fold gap) + **AUDIT.md** (audit pass 110 filed 0 findings but the sim harness has no status-engagement reporting). Phase 162 (combat audit) + Phase 163 (boss threat tuning) confirm `/combat-tuning` is active and producing balance decisions — but the sim's `buildCombatSummary` output doesn't surface how much of the damage came from DoT vs GUARD mitigation vs basic strike vs gold cards. The CLAUDE.md doctrine explicitly says "treat low status-effect engagement as a balance failure" — without a metric, `/combat-tuning` cannot enforce that. **DOCTRINE-CRITICAL gap.**
- scope: Extend `simulateHazardPatternCombat` / `buildCombatSummary` to track and report: (a) fraction of total HP-damage dealt via DoT (tick events) vs basic-strike vs gold-card burst vs other; (b) GUARD-mitigated-damage ratio; (c) mean status effects active on enemy at end of each phase. Add these to the `CombatBalanceReport` type + the combat-sim CLI `--report` output. Extend `hazard-pattern-combat.balance.sim.test.ts` to assert the new fields are non-zero in representative sim runs.
- unblocks: Makes the doctrine's "low status-effect engagement = balance failure" quantifiable and mechanically enforceable by `/combat-tuning`. Without this, balance passes tune HP totals and threat numbers but cannot distinguish a "status-heavy win" from a "basic-attack-only win".
- blocked-by: None — depends only on the shipped HP-only combat engine (`simulateHazardPatternCombat`, `hazard-pattern-combat.balance.sim.test.ts`).
- score: 7 × 7 / 10 = 4.9
- recommended-slot: next combat-depth phase; pairs with any /combat-tuning run

### Candidate: HP-model DoT amplifier (Catalyst successor for HP-only win model)
- signal: **specs/** — Spec 26 Catalyst (pass-75 candidate, score 5.6) is stale against the HP-only model, but its core engagement insight is sound and doctrine-central: **the "build-then-detonate" moment is the highest-leverage engagement mechanic missing from HP-model combat.** The new architecture makes this simpler — no pressure-track abstraction needed. DoT ticks now deal direct HP damage; amplifying `pendingDotDamage` against the enemy's HP is a natural extension of the existing `analyzeDotErosion` / `pendingDotDamage` computation in `effect-resolution.ts`. **DOCTRINE-CENTRAL.**
- scope: Add an `amplify` verb class to `CombatVerbClass` and a `{ kind: 'amplify', multiplier }` card mechanic in `combat.cards.ts`: a card that reads the enemy's `pendingDotDamage` (from `analyzeDotErosion`), multiplies it by N (e.g. 2.0), and fires the multiplied burst as a one-time HP-damage event (distinct from ongoing DoT ticks). Author 1–2 Amplifier skill cards (base + gold variant). Emit an `amplify-detonated` `CombatEvent`, credit the burst in `buildCombatSummary`'s new status-engagement metrics (pairs with candidate 2 above). Add the multiplier + amplifier card count to `/combat-tuning`'s tunable surface.
- unblocks: The "watch the number explode" payoff moment from StS Catalyst — the decisive, legible spike that makes DoT-stack building feel rewarding and confirms the doctrine that status-effect play is the efficient path. Without this, DoT damage is linear and imperceptible; with it, the player has a skill-expression moment.
- blocked-by: None — depends only on shipped HP-only combat (`combat.cards.ts`, `effect-resolution.ts`, `analyzeDotErosion`). Simpler than Spec 26 (no pressure track abstraction). Should be re-specified in a new spec file (e.g. `specs/26b-hp-model-amplifier.md`) before ship.
- score: 7 × 7 / 10 = 4.9
- recommended-slot: after status-engagement metrics (candidate 2) so the metric can validate amplifier impact

### Candidate: Minor dependency patch bumps
- signal: **AUDIT.md Pending** — 3 safe minor/patch bumps: `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` 8.61.1→8.62.0, `typescript-eslint` 8.61.1→8.62.0, `globals` 17.6.0→17.7.0. Filed per the ≥2.5 aggressive threshold. **Note: iterate-eligible** (a single `npm install --save-dev` + `npm run verify` commit); only filed as a candidate because iterate hasn't picked it up and the AUDIT row is live.
- scope: Run `npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@^8.62.0 typescript-eslint@^8.62.0 globals@^17.7.0`, verify `npm run verify` green, commit `chore(deps): patch bumps — @typescript-eslint 8.62.0 / globals 17.7.0`. `@types/node` 25.9.4→26.0.0 is a major bump — skip. Drain the AUDIT.md Pending dep row.
- unblocks: Keeps lint toolchain on latest patch; eliminates the AUDIT.md noise.
- blocked-by: None.
- score: 3 × 9 / 10 = 2.7
- recommended-slot: any iterate tick (autonomous)

### Candidate: Spec 26 — Catalyst (multiplicative status scaling)
- signal: `specs/26-catalyst-multiplicative-scaling.md` (drafted 1226517, UNSTARTED) — expand §4 signal 4 (unstarted spec) + signal 5 (the 2026-06-21 hazard-pattern-combat braindump "build-then-detonate" open question). **DOCTRINE-CENTRAL.**
- scope: Add an `amplifier` verb class + a `{ kind: 'catalyst', multiplier, consumesStacks? }` skill mechanic to Hazard-Pattern Combat: a card that reads the enemy's Phase 125 `pendingDotDamage`, multiplies it by N, and dumps the result onto the DoT track as a single legible spike (sidestepping the `MAX_EFFECT_INTENSITY` cap). Author 1–2 Catalyst skills (base + `r_` upgrade), emit a `catalyst-detonated` CombatEvent, credit the spike in `buildCombatSummary`, and add the multiplier to `/combat-tuning`'s tunable surface.
- unblocks: The single biggest engagement gap Spec 25 named — the new combat's pressure is strictly *linear*, so there is no build-then-detonate decision and no exponential "watch the number explode" payoff. Highest-leverage status-depth addition.
- blocked-by: None — depends only on shipped Spec 25 (`combat.pressure.ts` / `combat.cards.ts`) + Phase 125 DoT projection. Spec §4 has unanswered `> Your answer:` rows but ships with a recommended default (Option B detonation).
- score: 7 × 8 / 10 = 5.6
- recommended-slot: first of the Spec 26-30 combat-depth cluster

### Candidate: Spec 27 — Card Salvage (cards used multiple ways)
- signal: `specs/27-card-salvage-sideways-play.md` (drafted 1226517, UNSTARTED) — expand §4 signal 4. **DOCTRINE-CENTRAL** (deepens the per-phase hand puzzle + die economy that powers status play).
- scope: Add `salvageCombatCard(state, { uid }, rng?)` to `combat.engine.ts` — spend any eligible hand card sideways (no die spent, card to discard) to mint a temporary stance-colour die (mirroring Hazard's `discardHazardCard`/`HazardSalvage`), capped per-phase (≈2), tracked as `salvagesThisPhase` reset in `processBetweenPhases`. Expose salvage eligibility/preview on the card view; add the cap + benefit magnitude to `/combat-tuning`.
- unblocks: The "near-dead card" problem — a wrong-stance/unaffordable card becomes a usable die instead of dead weight, smoothing the die economy and making the hand a Mage-Knight-style puzzle rather than a draw lottery.
- blocked-by: None — depends only on shipped Spec 25 (hand/dice/pressure). Hazard salvage is the reference pattern. Spec §4 ships with recommended defaults (temp die, consumes card, cap 2/phase).
- score: 6 × 6 / 10 = 3.6
- recommended-slot: after Spec 26 (independent; can ship in any order within the cluster)

### Candidate: Spec 28 — Curated Combat Deck + Synergy
- signal: `specs/28-curated-combat-deck-and-synergy.md` (drafted 1226517, UNSTARTED) — expand §4 signal 4. **DOCTRINE-CENTRAL** (deck-as-engine is how a DoT build is made to feel different from a control build).
- scope: Replace `buildCombatDeck(player) = knownSkills + Retreat` with a curated loadout (Spec 25 §12 Q3's 8–10 → 15–20 cards), persisted via the Hazard deck-flags codec pattern (`HAZARD_CARD_FLAG_PREFIX`/`decodeAcquiredCards`), plus explicit synergy payoffs that surface the already-authored `SkillSynergy`/`SynergyPredicate` combos (e.g. `resonance-burst`) on the combat board. A deck-builder selection surface + per-encounter loadout.
- unblocks: The deck-building meta-game both reference titles are built on — today the deck only *dilutes* as you learn more skills (the opposite of building an engine). Turns skill-learning into a build decision.
- blocked-by: None for the engine half; the deck-builder UI is mobile-side. Larger surface than 26/27 (persistence + a selection screen). Spec §4 leans Option A (explicit loadout).
- score: 6 × 7 / 10 = 4.2
- recommended-slot: after Spec 26/27 (the curation layer they reference)

### Candidate: Spec 29 — Reactive Enemies + Telegraphed Intent
- signal: `specs/29-reactive-enemies-telegraphed-intent.md` (drafted 1226517, UNSTARTED) — expand §4 signal 4. **DOCTRINE-CENTRAL** + the primary answer to the reconciliation-gaps §5 "too similar to Hazard?" identity question (a reactive opponent is what Hazard *cannot* have).
- scope: Turn the static `CombatThreatPhase` sequence into a reactive opponent — telegraphed intents that cleanse stacked DoT, harden the raced track, or enrage near threshold, all shown in the full-information timeline so the player must adapt (switch tracks / race the cleanse / spend before the harden). Reuse the effects engine's existing `applyCleanse`/`applyDispel` primitives; surface intent on `resolveThreatPhase`.
- unblocks: The "static puzzle" risk — Spec 25 fights resolve in ~2 flat phases with no adaptation demanded; reactive intents add the Slay-the-Spire/Into-the-Breach counterplay loop and give combat an identity distinct from Hazard.
- blocked-by: None — depends only on shipped Spec 25 (`combat.threat.ts`) + the effects engine. Spec §4 ships a recommended first ability set (Cleanse/Harden/Enrage).
- score: 6 × 7 / 10 = 4.2
- recommended-slot: after the deck cluster; pairs with the §5 identity decision (attended)

### Candidate: Spec 30 — Projected Lethality Readout (the foreseeable kill)
- signal: `specs/30-projected-lethality-readout.md` (drafted 1226517, UNSTARTED) — expand §4 signal 4. **DOCTRINE-CENTRAL** (the presentation gap that makes status wins *feel* satisfying — the load-bearing fun is "exploiting status effects").
- scope: Surface the already-computed Phase 125 `analyzeDotErosion` projection (`pendingDotDamage`, `roundsToKill`) onto `CombatEncounterState` + the event stream as a live "lethal in N phases / X pending" readout, plus a Detonate/Finish affordance once the enemy is lethal-in-flight. Smallest engine surface of the five (the math already exists internally; the work is exposing it + a presenter).
- unblocks: The legibility gap Spec 25's own e2e flagged — the DoT track "doesn't visibly advance" mid-phase, so the player can't feel the erosion winning. Makes erosion a telegraphed, decisive conclusion (Into-the-Breach "you've already won" foresight).
- blocked-by: None — projection exists in `effect-resolution.ts`; depends only on shipped Spec 25 + Phase 125. Lowest-risk, highest-legibility-per-effort of the cluster.
- score: 5 × 8 / 10 = 4.0
- recommended-slot: can ship early — small engine surface, immediate doctrine payoff

### Candidate: Public-surface guard follows `export *` re-exports
- signal: CRITIQUE.md Pending **[HIGH] structure** (critique-78, commit 9cc1437) — `scripts/snapshot-public-surface.mjs` `EXPORT_LINE_RE` (line 36) only matches `export { … } from '…'` lines and silently ignores all five `export * from './World/<sub>'` barrels (Hazard/Gathering/QuestBoard/Rest/LootCache; src/index.ts:238-239, dist/index.d.ts:21-25). Phase 160's ~13 sim value/type exports (`simulateRest`/`runRestSim`/`generateRestBalanceReport`/`simulateLootCache`/`runLootCacheSim`/`generateLootCacheBalanceReport`/`DEFAULT_CACHE_ITEMS`/`DEFAULT_CACHE_CURRENCY`/`LOOT_CACHE_BITE_PENALTY` + Rest/LootCache sim types) are LIVE at the package root yet absent from the fixture, and `npm run deploy:check` still exits 0. Any add/rename/remove behind those five barrels evades the contract guard entirely. Per expand §4 signal 2 (HIGH findings iterate can't drain in one tick → refactor phase): this is the guard-integrity class, not a docs drain.
- scope: Extend `snapshotPublicSurface` to resolve each `export * from './sub'` line by reading the corresponding `dist/<sub>/index.d.ts` (one level for the five known World submodules) and folding its named exports into the values/types sets, then refresh `scripts/public-surface.expected.json` with `--write` so the 13 Phase-160 sim exports become guarded. Add a hermetic guard test asserting the live snapshot covers a known `export *`-only export (e.g. `simulateRest`/`LOOT_CACHE_BITE_PENALTY`). Alternatively (if the sims are intentionally NOT public contract): convert src/index.ts:238-239 from `export *` to explicit named re-exports so snapshot and intent agree. Decide which submodule barrels are contract surface during the brief.
- unblocks: Restores end-to-end integrity of the publish/deploy contract guard — future submodule-barrel changes (Rest/LootCache/Hazard/Gathering/QuestBoard) regain add/rename/remove drift detection instead of silently shipping. Removes a latent blind spot before more `export *` barrels accrete.
- blocked-by: None — snapshot script + deploy:check + fixture all present.
- score: 7 × 6 / 10 = 4.2
- recommended-slot: next, ahead of further content/minigame work (guard-integrity is foundational)

### Candidate: Northern Forest Region Content Extension
- signal: Phase 117 expanded fishing-village from 10→25 nodes; northern-forest remains at baseline size but is a major progression gate. Natural follow-up to successful fishing-village expansion pattern.
- scope: Expand northern-forest from current node count to 20-25 nodes with 2-3 sub-areas, following Phase 117's proven pattern. Add region-specific encounters, hazards, and NPCs that leverage the forest theme and higher difficulty tier.
- unblocks: Mid-game content variety; provides progression stepping stone between fishing-village and endgame
- blocked-by: None - MapEvents engine, content authoring patterns, region architecture all established
- score: 5 × 6 / 10 = 3.0
- recommended-slot: Content expansion phase

### Phase 160 — Phase 137 minigame sims + CLIs (subsumes "Hazard simulation harness")
- promoted: 2026-06-20 via oversight (Q1: T selected NEEDS_ATTENTION §3 + §4 to refuel the empty autonomous queue).
- source: NEEDS_ATTENTION.md §3 (QuestBoard/Rest/LootCache have no sims) + §4 (CLI doesn't play the Phase 137 minigames) + the standing "Hazard simulation harness" candidate (utility-deck CLI injection + utility-aware bot + the `ts-node` game.cli.ts:185 repair blocker), all folded into one sims+CLIs cluster.
- build-plan row: `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md` (Phase 159, `[ ]` pending).
- note: refine via `/plan-a-phase` before ship; may split into sub-units (build sims first, CLI play loops second) if the phase runs large.

### Rest minigame design brainstorm (ATTENDED — not an autonomous phase)
- promoted: 2026-06-20 via oversight (Q2: T pick — "rest mini game brainstorm").
- source: standing "Rest minigame design brainstorm" candidate. T wants a more engaging rest mechanic (player agency + resource-management depth; prior art: Gordian Quest camp, Darkest Dungeon, Hades boons).
- routing: **attended** — requires T in an interactive `/brainstorm-mechanics` session; deliberately NOT a build-plan `[ ]` row so `/march` won't auto-dispatch it. Output: `braindump/rest-minigame-<date>.md` + a recommended direction, then a follow-on spec phase.
- next action: run the brainstorm in the next attended session (T-initiated).

### Phase 152 — Affix item library wiring and curated prefixed/suffixed gear
- promoted: 2026-06-17 by T direct steering; priority override above all else.
- source: T accepted the affix-audit verdict and specified the implementation law: add `prefixId`/`suffixId` plus `prefixName`/`suffixName`, make `dropItemWithAffixes` populate them, add affix defaults to `dropItem` by rarity, trim the item library, and add curated prefixed/suffixed items.
- brief: `plan/phases/phase_152_affix_item_library_wiring.md`
- build-plan row: `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`

### Phase 151 — Item modifier catalogue audit and expansion
- promoted: 2026-06-16 by T direct steering
- source: T requested an audit of item modifiers (prefixes and suffixes), then adding exactly 20 prefixes and 20 suffixes.
- brief: `plan/phases/phase_151_item_modifier_catalogue_audit_and_expansion.md`
- build-plan row: `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`


### Phases 145–148 — Minigame playtesting harness (split into 4 phases)
- promoted: 2026-06-14 (oversight Q1 — T write-in: "balancing all the minigames — many phases, little by little; build a harness first — A/B, e2e, playstyle subagents"). Split into 4 phases to keep context windows manageable. Build-plan rows added as Phases 145–148. No balance changes in any of these phases — infrastructure only. Phase 149+ make incremental balance changes, each verified by the full harness.
  - **Phase 145**: Quest Board simulator (biggest gap; no sim today)
  - **Phase 146**: Hazard A/B + playstyle layer (extends existing `hazard.sim.ts`)
  - **Phase 147**: Gathering A/B + playstyle layer (extends existing `gathering.sim.ts`)
  - **Phase 148**: Composable harness wrapper (blocked by 145/146/147; ties all three into one invocable suite)
- Source: T oversight 2026-06-14 write-in + refinement.

### Phase 143 — Dependency modernization (major bumps)
- promoted: 2026-06-13 (oversight Q2 — T pick: "File one modernization phase"). Build-plan row added as Phase 143. Scope: drain the three live AUDIT major-version findings (Category G) in one deliberate phase — TypeScript 5→6 (3.6), inquirer 9→12 (2.8), globals 16→17 (2.7); resolve breaking changes; keep the gate green. Tooling/deps only. Source: AUDIT.md Pending pass 52.

### Phase 142 — Status-effect depth (doctrine-central)
- promoted: 2026-06-13 (oversight Q1 — T pick: "File status-effect depth phase"). Net-new direction, no prior candidate row. Build-plan row added as Phase 142. **Doctrine-load-bearing** (CLAUDE.md: status effects are the MAIN fun in combat encounters). Scope: deepen status-effect breadth/synergy and re-examine Phase 125/126/130 resolution thresholds so engaged-but-unresolved timeout cells yield/die, WITHOUT a basic-attack-trade regression (STRATEGIST status engagement ≥40% floor). Values/registry/content only — no core resolution-formula rewrites, no new outcome union members. Pin exact scope at an attended `/plan-a-phase` brief before shipping. Source: T oversight 2026-06-13 directive + Phase 126/130 closeout signal.

### Phase 141 — Unlocked skill access (spec Phase 99)
- promoted: 2026-06-13 (oversight Q1 — T pick: "Promote Phase 99 (skill access)"). Was "Unlocked Skill Access (Phase 99)" (score 4 × 8 / 10 = 3.2). Build-plan row added as Phase 141. Scope: remove the legacy equipped-skill/loadout gate; learned/unlocked skills become the whole combat catalogue, filtered at use-time by `canUseSkill()`. Implements specs/README **NEXT** recommended-order spec. Source: PHASE_CANDIDATES Pending + specs/README.

### Phase 140 — Hazard minigame vs divergence documentation audit
- promoted: 2026-06-11 (oversight T write-in: "double check the current hazard minigame against the deviations documentation"). Build-plan row added as Phase 140. Scope: verify current hazard implementation (post-Phase-134 + Phase-135) satisfies every item in `docs/hazard-v2-vs-mechanics-divergence.md`; walk each divergence item for implementation status and parity-test coverage; surface any gaps to T before patching. Source: T oversight 2026-06-11.

### Phase 139 — Combat Resource Economy Analysis
- promoted: 2026-06-11 (oversight Q2 — T pick). Was "Combat Resource Economy Analysis" (score 5 × 5 / 10 = 2.5). Build-plan row added as Phase 139. Scope: comprehensive analysis of resource generation rates vs skill costs; measure resource-starved/flooded patterns; tune action generation rates and skill costs for pacing; add telemetry where gaps found. Source: expand candidate.

### Phase 138 — Friendship/nonlethal route expressiveness on lethal anchors
- promoted: 2026-06-11 (oversight Q2 — T pick). Was "Friendship / nonlethal route expressiveness on lethal anchors" (score 6 × 6 / 10 = 3.6). Build-plan row added as Phase 138. Scope: make mercy route reachable on Easy/Normal three-anchor enemies without breaking lethal-anchor win bands; tune befriendability configs, HP-gate interaction, and/or friendship-rate policy; add friendship-rate target band to three-anchor matrix. Source: Phase-121-closeout signal.

### Phase 137 — ESLint hazard as-any cast cleanup
- promoted: 2026-06-11 (oversight Q1 — T pick: "Both"). Was "ESLint type-safety cleanup for hazard files" (score 6 × 7 / 10 = 4.2). Build-plan row added as Phase 137. Scope: remove 6 `as any` casts from `hazard.persistence.engine.test.ts` and `hazard.engine.ts`; add proper TypeScript typing. Source: expand-51 AUDIT finding.

### Phase 136 — Tuning module comprehensive test coverage
- promoted: 2026-06-11 (oversight Q1 — T pick: "Both"). Was "Tuning module comprehensive test coverage" (score 8 × 6 / 10 = 4.8). Build-plan row added as Phase 136. Scope: add comprehensive hermetic e2e tests for Tuning module's 19 source files (analyst.bridge.ts, engagement.metrics.ts, health.metrics.ts, matrix.builder.ts, matrix.runner.ts, experiment.runner.ts). Source: expand-51 AUDIT finding.

### Phase 135 — Hazard Minigame — Persistent World-State Tracking
- promoted: 2026-06-11 (oversight Q1 — T pick). Was "Hazard Minigame — Persistent World-State Tracking" (score 8 × 8 / 10 = 6.4). Blocker (Phase 131 base hazard + Phase 134 mobile v2 alignment) both shipped. Build-plan row added as Phase 135. Scope: extend `WorldState` / `MapState` for hazard-outcome persistence — per-node outcome flags (cleared/blocked/modified), `HazardModifierTable` for future threshold adjustments, route-blocking state for map dispatcher; wire H08/H12/H15 hazard cards to emit and consume these flags; hermetic e2e + `docs/hazard-minigame.md` ⚑ deferral note removal. Source: CDR-0006 doctrine + expand candidate.

### Phase 134 — Hazard Mobile v2 Alignment
- promoted: 2026-06-10 (T direct order). Source: mobile shipped local hazard v2 engine and divergence catalogue `axiomancer-mobile/docs/hazard-v2-vs-mechanics-divergence.md`; copied into mechanics as `docs/hazard-v2-vs-mechanics-divergence.md`. Scope: replace Phase 131 / CDR-0006 v0 hazard semantics with mobile v2 force/escape rules; port mobile cards, dice, hazards, reward/penalty tiers, no-recast dice economy, deterministic RNG, and parity tests; update docs/API so mobile can consume the mechanics package and retire duplicated local rules. Brief: `plan/phases/phase_134_hazard_mobile_v2_alignment.md`. Tracks mechanics #154 and unblocks mobile #333.

### Phase 133 — Equipment Rarity Distribution Rebalancing
- promoted: 2026-06-09 (oversight Q3 — T pick). Was "Equipment Rarity Distribution Rebalancing" (score 4 × 7 / 10 = 2.8). Build-plan row added as Phase 133. Scope: audit drop rates, rarity weights, modifier distributions since Phase 54; rebalance for meaningful progression feel; config/balance only — no formula rewrites. Source: expand-34.

### Phase 132 — Game Module Documentation Coverage
- promoted: 2026-06-09 (oversight Q3 — T pick). Was "Game Module Documentation Coverage" (score 4 × 7 / 10 = 2.8). Build-plan row added as Phase 132. Scope: author docs/game.md covering store, selectors, GameState, persistence, reducers, constants; follows established module doc pattern. Source: expand-46 (AUDIT.md LOW).

### Phase 127 — Third enemy class family (undead/construct/elemental)
- promoted: 2026-06-08 (oversight Q2 — T picked Second Enemy Family to refill the empty build-plan queue). Was "Second Enemy Class Family Implementation" (score 7 × 6 / 10 = 4.2); renumbered Phase 127 since Phase 114 already shipped the second family. Build-plan row added under "Next up". Scope: 4–5 enemies (undead/construct/elemental) across normal/elite/boss with family mechanics + befriendability + alignment distributions + friendship rewards/journal entries; extend spawn pools. Source: expand-31.

### Phase 128 — Story content NPCs dialogue expansion (alignment-gated, Talk + moral-choice structure)
- promoted: 2026-06-08 (oversight Q2 — T picked Story NPCs to refill the empty queue, and specified a dialogue-choice structure). Was "Story Content NPCs Dialogue Expansion" (score 6 × 6 / 10 = 3.6). Build-plan row added under "Next up". T-specified structure (example, NOT doctrine): each encounter offers a `*Talk` option (more context, does not end the encounter) plus ~3 alignment-differentiated options with distinct consequence shapes — e.g. "God will help you" (alignment change only) / "I will help you" (alignment change + item/health lost) / "I'll take what you have unseen" (alignment change + item gained). Map to `alignmentDelta` + effect/item surfaces; pick per-NPC consequences. Source: expand-31 + T oversight directive.

### Phase 121 — Three-anchor playtest balance scaffold
- promoted: 2026-06-05 (T direct order after Sage/enemy balance planning pass). User priority override; no score needed.
- source: T requested a three-enemy playtest face: Easy level-6 Coastal Tyrant, Normal level-15 non-boss, Difficult-but-doable level-18 boss; Sage gets 2–3 devastating skills; each enemy is tested 25 times per playstyle/strategy. Enemies obey level × 5 stat law. Metric is actual Sage win rate.
- scope: Replace the single Coastal Tyrant witness with a three-anchor playtest matrix; fix Coastal Tyrant stats/skills; add the level-15 normal enemy and level-18 boss; tune/report actual-win bands 100%, 75–100%, and 25–50% with per-policy breakdowns. Brief: `plan/phases/phase_121_three_anchor_playtest_balance_scaffold.md`.

### Phase 120 — Phase 66 synergy walkthrough (requires preset extension)
- promoted: 2026-06-05 (T direct oversight order: "Promote 5, 4, and 1"). Score 4 × 7 / 10 = 2.8.
- source: Phase 81 deferred Unit 2 scope after Phase 66 synergy skills were not present in presets.
- scope: Extend Wanderer/Tier 2 preset access to selected Phase 66 synergy skills, then author a synergy-skills walkthrough pair and docs inventory row so the synergy library has player-experience-tier coverage. Brief: `plan/phases/phase_120_phase_66_synergy_walkthrough.md`.

### Phase 119 — Mid-game reference playtest probe (Phase 104 coverage gap)
- promoted: 2026-06-05 (T direct oversight order: "Promote 5, 4, and 1"). Score urgency 4 × value 5 / 10 = 2.0, promoted by user priority despite below-threshold score.
- source: Phase 104 early/endgame probes left the northern-forest midgame tier unmeasured.
- scope: Add a level-6 Wanderer/northern-forest elite reference probe script, documentation, and playtest README integration. Brief: `plan/phases/phase_119_mid_game_reference_playtest_probe.md`.

### Phase 118 — Tier 3 fallacy skill descriptions enrichment
- promoted: 2026-06-05 (T direct oversight order: "Promote 5, 4, and 1"). Score urgency 3 × value 8 / 10 = 2.4, promoted by user priority despite below-threshold score.
- source: Phases 114-117 content work highlighted sparse Tier 3 capstone skill descriptions.
- scope: Enrich descriptions for the seven Tier 3 fallacy skills in `src/Skills/library/tier3.ts`; update `docs/skills.md`; no mechanical changes. Brief: `plan/phases/phase_118_tier_3_fallacy_skill_descriptions_enrichment.md`.

### Phase 117 — Northern-forest expansion (Phase 65 pattern applied to `nf-*`)
- promoted: 2026-06-04 (oversight). User pick (Q1 — all four). Score 5 × 6 / 10 = 3.0.
- source: expand-21. Content-scale parity between the two authored regions.
- scope: Grow `nf-*` from 11 to ~25 nodes, 2–3 sub-areas, ~14 new `MapEventPool` entries (~60% `alignmentDelta` density), hermetic e2e + docs + CHANGELOG. Phase 65 recipe applied verbatim; existing spine preserved.

### Phase 116 — Difficulty-curve doctrine spec (`specs/15-difficulty-curve.md`)
- promoted: 2026-06-04 (oversight). User pick (Q1 + Q2 — design-attended at brief dispatch). Score 5 × 6 / 10 = 3.0.
- source: expand-29. Converts ad-hoc per-oversight band calls into a referenceable written spec.
- scope: Author `specs/15-difficulty-curve.md` with target bands per tier (65–75% resolution success + rounds-to-resolve + damage ratio). Pre-fill `> Your answer:` lines at the attended brief dispatch. `specs/README.md` row added.

### Phase 115 — Story Content NPCs Dialogue Expansion
- promoted: 2026-06-04 (oversight). User pick (Q1). Score 5.5 × 6.5 / 10 = 3.6.
- source: expand-31 + spec.md 6-month horizon.
- scope: 3–5 named NPCs with multi-branch dialogue trees, philosophical alignment gates, moral choice consequences, Chronicle integration, flagSet quest chains. Establishes NPC content patterns for future story expansion.

### Phase 114 — Second Enemy Class Family Content Expansion
- promoted: 2026-06-04 (oversight). User pick (Q1). Score 6 × 7 / 10 = 4.2.
- source: expand-31 + spec.md 6-month horizon.
- scope: 8–12 new enemies in a second family with diverse AI patterns (beyond randomLogic variants), befriendability configs at all tiers, philosophical alignment variety across multiple cube cells, varied combat resources/skill resistance patterns.

### Phase 107 — Roster-wide difficulty tuning via the Phase 104 reference probes (stale-row cleanup)
- promoted: 2026-06-02 (T direct decision). **Shipped** — Phase 107 has since shipped; this row moved from ## Pending (where it was stale with "PROMOTED as Phase 107" annotation) to ## Promoted at oversight 2026-06-04 for tracking hygiene.
- source: expand-29. User's recurring top concern: "difficulty is all over the place / no order".
- scope: Roster-wide measurement via Phase 104 probes + iterative parameter tuning until ~70% win rate. Preflight + measure + tune loop + closeout.

### Phase 105 — Glanton Nexus state reconciliation guardrail
- promoted: 2026-06-01 (T direct approval after Glanton hire). Runs before Phase 104/101/102 because stale Nexus state can cause workers to march under old orders. Score 8 × 7 / 10 = 5.6.
- source: T concern that Hermes conversation decisions and Nexus (`/march`, `/oversight`) state collide; memory files, central ledger, build plans, and decisioning are often out of sync.
- scope: Audit central ledger vs mechanics-local Nexus state, document source-of-truth hierarchy, add `/oversight` decision-sync checklist, add `/march` state-sanity preflight, and patch obvious stale rows discovered during the phase. Full row in `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`.
- unblocks: Prevents Phase 104/101/102 workers from acting on stale Pending rows, deferred continent work, or undrained critique ghosts.

### Phase 98 — Items + skill-resource integration AUDIT (RESCOPED at oversight-26)
- promoted: 2026-05-29 (twenty-fifth oversight; original scope "Item rarity system / Spec 05c", score 8.0). **RESCOPED 2026-05-30 (twenty-sixth oversight).**
- source: Candidate "Item rarity system (Spec 05c)" — but that candidate (and the sibling 05d/05e candidates) were filed by expand-26 against **already-shipped specs**. Verified at oversight-26: Spec 05c acceptance checklist all `[x]` (`EquipmentTemplate`/`ItemRarity`/`requiredLevel`/`dropItem()`/22 templates/archived 50-item library in `src/Items/`); Spec 05d all `[x]` (`modifier.catalogue.ts` + `rollModifiers`/`resolveModifiers`); Spec 05e shipped at Phase 54 (`set.engine.ts` + `getActiveSetBonuses`). No rewrite is needed.
- scope (rescoped): Read-only **audit** that the item-modifier + set-bonus + skill-resource systems work end-to-end in play (not merely present as code). Unit 1 — item modifiers (`dropItem` mod-count/value-band correctness; rolled mods apply in combat post-Phase-80 pure-split). Unit 2 — set bonuses (`getActiveSetBonuses` thresholds; combat-start token stacking; generation-bonus chaining; combat-scoped passives). Unit 3 — skills vs resource generation (re-verify the Phase 77 token-economy contract end-to-end; no regression). Drops CRITIQUE rows for any drift; no behaviour change unless a real bug surfaces. Full row in `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`. User direction at oversight-26 Q1: "Rescope as an audit which should include item modifiers" + free-form "make sure skills are working correctly based on the resource generation".
- unblocks: Confirms the item-modifier / set-bonus / skill-resource systems are trustworthy before any new content phase leans on them.

### Phase 99 — Unlocked skill access, no equipped-skill gate
- promoted: 2026-05-31 (T correction after resource/skill doctrine cleanup). Follows Phase 98 so item/resource audit evidence runs before the access-model change.
- source: T correction — skills should not be "equipped"; once learned/unlocked they should be available, and combat should show only skills usable at that moment.
- scope: Remove the legacy player-facing `equippedSkills` loadout gate. `knownSkills` becomes the learned/unlocked combat-accessible catalogue; combat/CLI/playtest consumers filter by `canUseSkill(combatResources, skill)`; legacy `equippedSkills` saves/states are normalized into `knownSkills`; dev tools and docs stop treating skill equipment as canonical. Full brief: `plan/phases/phase_99_unlocked_skill_access.md`.
- unblocks: Fixes the manual-playtest UX failure where learned skills are unavailable because they are not equipped, and aligns mobile/combat surfaces with the resource/resonance doctrine.

### Phase 103 — Combat re-trigger lock fix (playtest jot #89(a))
- promoted: 2026-06-01 (twenty-seventh oversight; Q1 user pick — "Promote, run NEXT"). HIGH bug. Score 8 × 6 / 10 = 4.8.
- source: User manual playtest jot #89 (commit `b88d6b2`), decomposed item (a). Not a /expand candidate — surfaced from the user's own playtest.
- scope: After a WIN or FRIENDSHIP outcome the player cannot start another combat; after a LOSS (or restart) they can. Combat-end isn't clearing the encounter lock on win/friendship branches. Unit 1 — root-cause + fix in the combat-end / node-consumption path (store `endCombat` / END_COMBAT reducer / MapEvents combat-trigger gate); all three terminal outcomes must leave the next encounter startable. Unit 2 — hermetic e2e pinning victory/friendship/defeat → second-encounter-starts. Unit 3 — docs + CHANGELOG `### Fixed`. Full row in `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`. Runs ahead of all other pending phases.
- unblocks: Closes the last unaddressed engine item from playtest jot #89 (difficulty fixed at `557c7b2`; skill-equip at Phase 99; token-accumulation verified clean at Phase 77 + 98 → consumer-side).

### Phase 104 — Reference playtests: early-game + endgame (playtest jot #89(e))
- promoted: 2026-06-01 (twenty-seventh oversight; Q2 user pick — "Promote as a phase"). Score 6 × 6 / 10 = 3.6.
- source: User manual playtest jot #89 (commit `b88d6b2`), decomposed item (e).
- scope: Two reference Playtest fixtures — (1) level-1 / 5-5-5 vs easiest fishing-village enemies (early game); (2) max-level / max-stat / all-skills / all-items vs late-game/boss (endgame). Unit 1 — fixtures in `src/Playtest/` (reuse dev-tools max-out path). Unit 2 — report fields (survivability, rounds-to-resolve, damage bands) + hermetic playtest test. Unit 3 — docs (`docs/playtest.md`, `automation/playtest/NEXT_STEPS.md`). Pairs with Phase 101 (consumes the endgame probe). Full row in `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`.
- unblocks: Anchors balance testing on reproducible runs rather than ad-hoc manual sessions — addresses the "difficulty all over the place / no order" half of #89.

### Phase 100 — Second continent — Northern Continent stub  [DEFERRED INDEFINITELY]
- promoted: 2026-05-30 (twenty-sixth oversight; Q3 user pick). Score 5 × 7 / 10 = 3.5.
- **DEFERRED INDEFINITELY at oversight-27 (2026-06-01; Q3 user call): "Hold off on adding another continent until we have the base mechanics working. Defer that indefinitely."** Build-plan row flipped `[ ]` → `[deferred]`; not abandoned. Revisit once Phase 103 (re-trigger fix) + Phase 104 (reference playtests) + Phase 101 (mercy/difficulty tuning) land and core combat/progression feels solid. Flip back to `[ ]` at a future oversight to re-queue.
- source: Candidate "Second continent — Northern Continent stub".
- scope: Stand up `src/World/Continents/Northern-Continent/` with 1-2 starter maps (e.g. `northern-city`, `island-village`), each wired into a registered `MapEventPool` covering ≥5 of the 8 `MapEventKind` values; add to `MAP_REGISTRY`; hermetic e2e walks the new nodes. Establishes the pattern for continent 3+. `content/story/story-overview.md` already sketches the Northern Continent.
- unblocks: Actual story breadth — the coastal continent becomes an act-1 region rather than the whole game. (Gated behind base-mechanics stabilisation per oversight-27.)

### Phase 101 — Coastal Tyrant mercy-route tuning + playtest policy/report depth
- promoted: 2026-05-30 (twenty-sixth oversight; Q3 user pick). **Merges the two duplicate Pending rows** ("Coastal Tyrant mercy-route tuning + playtest policy/report depth" and the user-filed "Coastal Tyrant mercy tuning"). **Design-attended.** Score 6 × 5 / 10 = 3.0.
- source: Candidates "Coastal Tyrant mercy-route tuning + playtest policy/report depth" + "Coastal Tyrant mercy tuning (user-filed)".
- scope: Playtest evidence (25 runs `late-game-coastal-tyrant`: 9 victories / 0 defeats / 0 friendships / 16 timeouts; pure `friendship` policy hit counter 36 but never crossed the HP gate, avg final HP 455) says the boss friendship route is legible but unreachable. **T ruled on 2026-06-01 that this is a balance failure, not an intentional long-boss target.** Unit 1 — evidence refresh (`mercy` policy that wounds to the HP gate then spares; pure `friendship` as nonviolent-patience control; HP-gate report traces). Unit 2 — tuning doctrine: reduce timeout/stall and make wound-then-spare mercy resolve below the HP gate; only add an alternate pure-patience surrender predicate if evidence proves it belongs. Targets: timeout under 25%, at least one explicit wound-then-spare friendship path, no dominant defensive-only win pattern. Unit 3 — docs + guards (`NEXT_STEPS.md`, `docs/combat.md` if doctrine changes, hermetic playtest test). Full row in `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`.
- unblocks: A clean proving ground for boss mercy; prevents Coastal Tyrant teaching that mercy is possible in lore but unavailable in play.

### Phase 102 — Befriendable-enemy Tier-2 expansion (Phase 74 D2 deferred)
- promoted: 2026-05-30 (twenty-sixth oversight; Q3 user pick). **Design-attended at brief drafting.** Score 6 × 5 / 10 = 3.0.
- source: Candidate "Befriendable-enemy Tier-2 expansion (Phase 74 D2 deferred)".
- scope: Author the full Phase 60/62/68/69/71/73 befriend stack (`friendshipReward` + `flagSet` + `befriendabilityConfig` + `alignmentDelta` + `pactLines` + `journalEntry`) onto a user-chosen subset of the 4 Phase 74 D2 candidates (TideflukeReaver, HushWraith, TheDisagreement, HollowSaint). Unit 1 — per-enemy content; Unit 2 — hermetic e2e (extend befriend + aftermath-lines registration); Unit 3 — docs + CHANGELOG. Expands the befriendable roster 3 → 4-7. All engine surface shipped; no blockers. Full row in `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`.
- unblocks: Meaningful befriend arcs at multiple tiers; each new befriendable demonstrates the full stack on a new tier of fight.

### Phase 97 — GH#78 previewStatAllocation API
- promoted: 2026-05-27 (twenty-fourth oversight). Feature — mobile needs exact derived-stats preview for stat allocation decisions. Score 4.2.

### Phase 96 — GH#74 BattleLogEntry type/runtime contract fix
- promoted: 2026-05-26 (twenty-third oversight). Bug fix — mobile crashes on boss-skill killing blows. Score 4.2.


### Phase 90 — v0.12.0 release cut (Phase 80-87 mechanic shift + audit sweep)
- promoted: 2026-05-25 (twenty-second oversight). Two BREAKING changes in [unreleased] need semver minor. Score 3.5.

### Phase 91 — `incrementsFriendship?: number` skill payload + 2-3 calming skills
- promoted: 2026-05-25 (twenty-second oversight). New gameplay primitive. Score 3.0.

### Phase 92 — Difficulty-meter gameplay scaling (`moralMeter` → engine multipliers)
- promoted: 2026-05-25 (twenty-second oversight). Design-attended. Score 3.0.

### Phase 93 — Damage-resist primitive (Phase 80 direction (a) damage-side follow-up)
- promoted: 2026-05-25 (twenty-second oversight). Completes direction (a). Score 3.0.

### Phase 94 — Tier 3 synergy / content expansion (mirror Phase 66 for Tier 3)
- promoted: 2026-05-25 (twenty-second oversight). End-game content. Score 3.0.

### Phase 95 — CHANGELOG public-surface diff autogeneration
- promoted: 2026-05-25 (twenty-second oversight). Tooling. Score 2.5.

### Phase 83 — Post-Phase-80 effect-application test sweep (regression coverage)
- promoted: 2026-05-24 (twentieth oversight; Q1 user pick — "All four post-80 follow-ups". Pre-staged immediately after Phase 80 per the candidate's recommended-slot.).
- signal: Phase 80 (Skills always-land effects + separate damage roll, direction (a) pure split — promoted at oversight-19 2026-05-24) will change the effect-application semantics of every Tier 1 / 2 / 3 skill. Every existing hermetic case that pins effect-application outcomes against the current roll-based model (`src/Combat/e2e/effect-application.engine.test.ts` + every skill-tier e2e under `src/Skills/e2e/` + the Combat-resolver scenario block pinning skillBlocked / skillResolved) needs re-authoring against the new always-land contract. Pre-Phase-80 the sweep can't ship; post-Phase-80 the regression-coverage gap surfaces immediately on the first /verify run. File now so it's queued as the natural successor — Phase 80's brief at dispatch will partial-cover this scope (drop the now-incorrect assertions); this candidate's job is the positive re-authoring (every case asserts the new contract: effect applied AND damage rolled separately AND damage resistance applied).
- scope: One phase, 2-3 commit units. **Unit 1 — Tier 1 + Tier 2 skill re-authoring.** Walk every skill in `src/Skills/skill.library.ts` Tier 1 (12 skills) + Tier 2 (8 skills incl. Phase 66 synergy batch); update hermetic cases pinning effect-application outcome to the new always-land contract. Damage-roll assertions split out into separate `it()` blocks so the effect-half / damage-half tension is visible at test-read time. **Unit 2 — Tier 3 + fallacy-as-spells re-authoring.** Walk Tier 3 (7 skills incl. Phase 44 fallacy-as-spells); same pattern. **Unit 3 — Integration sweep.** `src/Combat/e2e/combat.resolver.engine.test.ts` + `src/Game/e2e/befriend.engine.test.ts` + any agent-graded walkthrough pinning skill outcomes; update assertions for the new resolution shape. CHANGELOG entry + docs cross-link.
- unblocks: confirms Phase 80 didn't break any per-skill semantics that the old roll-based hermetic case-set was silently load-bearing for. Closes the regression-coverage window the mechanic shift opens.
- blocked-by: Phase 80 must ship first.
- score: 6 × 5 / 10 = 3.0 (high impact — without this, Phase 80's verify gate ships with reduced coverage; medium ease — pure test refactor against the shipped Phase 80 contract).
- recommended-slot: immediately after Phase 80.


### Phase 84 — Skill "fizzle" event + UX scrub post-Phase-80
- promoted: 2026-05-24 (twentieth oversight; Q1 user pick — "All four post-80 follow-ups". Closes the docs/content drift Phase 80 opens; could merge into Phase 83 at brief drafting if scope is small enough.).
- signal: Today the engine emits skill-fizzled / effect-application-failed events on the SkillEvent + SkillPhaseEvent surfaces; docs (`docs/skills.md`, `docs/combat.md`, `docs/gameloop.md`) reference fizzle semantics in multiple places; agent-graded walkthroughs may pin fizzle assertions; per-skill content authoring (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 skill descriptions in `src/Skills/skill.library.ts`) carries miss-flavor language ("if the target resists...", "may fail to apply...", etc.). After Phase 80 ships direction (a) pure split, fizzle disappears as an outcome — effects always land; the failure mode shifts to damage being mitigated (not the effect being skipped). The downstream surface needs a scrub: event guards (`isSkillFizzledEvent` if present), docs prose, walkthrough assertions, skill descriptions. Mirrors the Phase 71/72/73 GH#65 trio's per-Phase docs fold-in pattern (single phase, multiple readers).
- scope: One phase, 2-3 commit units. **Unit 1 — event surface scrub.** Walk `src/Game/events.types.ts` + the SkillEvent / SkillPhaseEvent definitions in `src/Skills/`; drop or rename fizzle event variants per Phase 80's contract; update `is*Event` guards on the public barrel. **Unit 2 — docs + content scrub.** `docs/skills.md` + `docs/combat.md` + `docs/gameloop.md` + `docs/effects.md` references to fizzle / miss-on-effect-application reframed; any miss-flavor language in `src/Skills/skill.library.ts` skill descriptions adjusted; `CHANGELOG.md [unreleased] ### Changed` entry. **Unit 3 (conditional) — walkthrough updates.** Any walkthrough in `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/` pinning fizzle behaviour gets re-authored.
- unblocks: closes the documentation/content drift Phase 80 opens. Without it, readers will encounter fizzle references in docs that don't reflect the new mechanic.
- blocked-by: Phase 80 must ship first. Pairs with the post-Phase-80 effect-application test sweep candidate (they could potentially merge into one phase if scope is small enough at brief drafting).
- score: 5 × 6 / 10 = 3.0 (medium-high impact — closes docs/content drift; medium-high ease — pure docs + small type/event surface adjustments).
- recommended-slot: after Phase 80; can ship in parallel with or merged into the post-80 test sweep candidate.


### Phase 85 — Combat-tuning audit (Knowledge-Gaps Q1/Q2/Q4/Q6/Q26 cluster)
- promoted: 2026-05-24 (twentieth oversight; Q1 user pick — "All four post-80 follow-ups". Closes 5 deferred Knowledge-Gaps Qs (Q1 single-roll model, Q2 damage formula, Q4 defend asymmetry, Q6 initiative, Q26 lethal-swingy). User-attended at brief drafting.).
- signal: Knowledge-Gaps carries five deferred combat-tuning Qs that have all been waiting since pre-loop: Q1 (single-roll-contest vs attacker-roll-vs-defense-roll model), Q2 (damage formula — attack-stat-scaled vs separate weapon die), Q4 (defend-action defense-base asymmetry: player-defends uses `getBaseStat` but enemy-defends uses `getDefenseStat`), Q6 (initiative / simultaneous vs sequential turns), Q26 (lethal-swingy vs forgiving tone). All five are tracked in `specs/02-combat-round-resolver.md` as "Deferred — combat-tuning. Revisit during a future balance pass." The user just touched combat mechanics at oversight-18 (Phase 77 audit) + oversight-19 (Phase 80 mechanic shift promotion) — the willingness window is open. Phase 80's pure-split (effect always lands, damage rolls separately + applies resistance) is itself a combat-tuning decision that touches Q1/Q2 territory; revisiting the broader Q-cluster naturally pairs with that shift. The aggressive 2.5+ filing threshold (set at the same oversight) is exactly the signal to surface this cluster — at the old 3.0+ implicit floor it would have stayed buried as five separate iterate-tier rows.
- scope: One audit phase, 1-2 commit units. **Unit 1 — audit.** Walk each of the five Qs against the live combat resolver (`src/Combat/phases/scenario.ts` + sibling phase files post-Phase-15 split) + `src/Combat/stats.ts` + the playtesting signal (any agent walkthroughs surfacing balance pain points). Produce a per-Q decision matrix: current shape × proposed shape × engine-touch estimate × test-sweep estimate. Drop findings as either (a) CRITIQUE rows if the audit surfaces inconsistencies, or (b) one Pending candidate per Q the user decides to actually act on. **Unit 2 (conditional) — small fixes.** If audit surfaces minor cleanup (e.g. Q4 defend asymmetry IS a bug rather than design call), ship as a bundled commit. Larger Q-driven decisions spawn their own candidates / phases.
- unblocks: closes a long-deferred multi-Q cluster. Whichever direction the user picks per Q becomes the canonical combat-math shape going forward. Pairs naturally with the post-Phase-80 effect-application test sweep candidate (the test sweep would absorb any Q-driven assertion updates).
- blocked-by: None on the engine side. Wants user-attended oversight to pick directions per Q at brief drafting. Best to ship after Phase 80 + the post-80 test sweep land so the new effect-resolution baseline is settled before re-touching the damage-roll / defense-base half.
- score: 6 × 5 / 10 = 3.0 (high impact — closes 5 deferred Qs in one pass; medium ease — pure audit + decision-matrix, but design-attended at oversight).
- recommended-slot: after Phase 80 + the post-80 effect-application test sweep candidate above.


### Phase 86 — Equipment generation audit under new effect-resolution model
- promoted: 2026-05-24 (twentieth oversight; Q1 user pick — "All four post-80 follow-ups". Last of the post-Phase-80 audit trio (78 skills, 79 effects, 86 equipment) under the new resolution model.).
- signal: Phase 80's pure-split (effect always lands, damage rolls separately + applies resistance) shifts the load-bearing mechanic that Equipment's modifier chains feed. `src/Items/modifier.engine.ts` (Phase 53 rolled-mod pipeline) authors `damageModifier` / `defenseModifier` / `resistModifier` rolls onto Equipment; Phase 54 Set Items aggregate these via `getActiveSetBonuses`; Phase 76 `previewTemplateAtAllRarities` exposes the full rarity-ladder preview to UI consumers. Under the pure-split model, `damageModifier` chains compose into the damage-half only (no longer affecting effect-application probability); `resistModifier` chains likewise gate the damage half only. The audit needs to confirm: (a) per-stat modifier chains still compose correctly across the split; (b) Set bonuses don't accidentally re-introduce effect-resistance through stacked modifiers; (c) unique-tier authored items (Paradox Loop, Bootstrap Shard) don't carry effect-resistance mods that become dead code; (d) the Phase 75/76 preview helpers still surface the right rolled-mod count per rarity tier. Pairs with the Phase 78/79 skills+effects audit bundle and the combat-tuning audit candidate above — three audits, three layers (skills, effects, equipment) — under the new effect-resolution model. AUDIT bias `equipment/items` (kept at oversight-19) weights this candidate's eventual findings 1.5×.
- scope: One audit phase, 1-2 commit units. **Unit 1 — audit.** Walk every modifier in `src/Items/modifier.library.ts` + every set bonus in `src/Items/set.library.ts` + every unique item in `src/Items/unique.library.ts` (if separate) against the post-Phase-80 effect-resolution model. Per-modifier table: name × current effect × post-Phase-80 effect × any drift. Drop findings as CRITIQUE rows. **Unit 2 (conditional) — small fixes.** Stale unique items with effect-resistance mods get retired / re-authored; any set bonus that double-counts post-Phase-80 gets adjusted. Larger findings spawn their own iterate / phase tickets.
- unblocks: closes the items-side audit gap that Phase 80 opens. Together with Phase 78 (skills) + Phase 79 (effects) covers all three layers under the new resolution model.
- blocked-by: Phase 80 must ship first (the new resolution model is the audit's load-bearing context).
- score: 5 × 5 / 10 = 2.5 (medium impact — audit surfaces drift, doesn't ship behaviour change; medium ease — pure read-walk + small drain commits). Aggressive 2.5+ threshold (set 2026-05-24) is exactly the bar this candidate clears that the prior 3.0+ implicit floor would have failed.
- recommended-slot: after Phase 80 + the post-80 test sweep + the combat-tuning audit. Last of the post-Phase-80 audit trio.


### Phase 87 — Per-module quickstart pages (Phase 67 pattern extension)
- promoted: 2026-05-24 (twentieth oversight; Q2 user pick — "Promote as Phase 83 (or next available number)". Slotted as Phase 87 since 83-86 promoted in Q1.).
- signal: Phase 67 (`docs/quickstart.md` — committed at `e16a857` per oversight-10) shipped a one-page tour of the engine surface, covering all 12 modules in a single index doc. The pattern was a hit at oversight-10 (user picked it from candidate pool). Each module entry in the quickstart table is one-row: marquee surface + phases-shipped list + cross-link to `docs/<module>.md`. The natural extension is per-module quickstart pages — a 1-page "getting started with X" doc per module that demonstrates a typical first-dispatch flow (e.g. `docs/quickstart-character.md` walks creating a character, allocating stat points, learning a skill; `docs/quickstart-combat.md` walks setting up an encounter, dispatching a round, reading the events; `docs/quickstart-items.md` walks the Phase 75/76 preview surfaces). Each is a 50-100 line doc with a runnable code sample. Mirrors `docs/api.md` (canonical reference) + `docs/quickstart.md` (index) + per-module `docs/<module>.md` (deep dive) by adding a fourth layer (per-module quickstart). Reduces the docs-discovery cost for new consumers (mobile / external) significantly.
- scope: One phase, ~5 commit units (or one bundled commit per module). **Per-module units:** `docs/quickstart-character.md` (createCharacter / allocateStatPoint / learnSkill / preset roster); `docs/quickstart-combat.md` (initializeCombat / resolveCombatRound / event subscription / friendship-outcome path); `docs/quickstart-items.md` (dropItem / previewTemplateAtRarity / equipItem / set bonuses); `docs/quickstart-skills.md` (executeSkill / synergy-fired events / Tier 1/2/3 ladder); `docs/quickstart-world.md` (resolveMapEvent / MapEventPool authoring / alignmentDelta). Each lands with a runnable code sample (mirrors Spec-12 acceptance) + cross-link to the deep-dive doc. `docs/quickstart.md` extended with a "Per-module quickstarts" section linking the five new pages.
- unblocks: closes a docs-discovery gap for new external consumers. Pairs with the agent-handoff use case (`docs/agents.md` "Where to look" table) — each row now points at both the deep-dive doc + the per-module quickstart.
- blocked-by: None — pure docs work. Wants no user-attended design pass beyond the per-module scope picks (which can happen at brief drafting under autonomy).
- score: 4 × 7 / 10 = 2.8 (medium impact — docs-discovery improvement, no engine change; high ease — pure docs authoring against well-defined patterns). Aggressive 2.5+ threshold catches this at the new bar; prior 3.0+ implicit floor would have left it filing as iterate-tier follow-up rows over many ticks.
- recommended-slot: any time. Independent of the Phase 78-82 bundle and the post-Phase-80 audit trio.

### Phase 78 — General skills audit (all 21 authored skills)
- promoted: 2026-05-24 (nineteenth oversight; user picked the mechanic-shift bundle at Q1 — Phase 78 is the skills-audit pre-work for Phase 80; ships before the mechanic shift so per-skill drift is mapped first).
- signal: **User-flagged at oversight-18 2026-05-23.** The skill library has grown to 21 authored skills across Tier 1 / 2 / 3 (per Spec 04b — 12 Tier 1 + 8 Tier 2 incl. Phase 66 synergy batch + 7 Tier 3 incl. Phase 44 fallacy-as-spells). User wants a general audit pass — likely sniffing for inconsistency between spec / docs / actual behaviour; possible balance issues; possible orphan exports; possible test gaps. Pairs naturally with the proposed skills-always-land mechanics change candidate (the audit would surface every skill's current resolution shape; the mechanic shift would re-author them).
- scope: One audit phase, 1-2 commit units. **Unit 1 — audit.** Walk every skill in `src/Skills/skill.library.ts`. Produce a per-skill audit table (skill id × {effect / damage / cost / resource grant / synergy / tier / hermetic test coverage}). Cross-check against `specs/04b-skills-library-and-e2e.md` acceptance + `docs/skills.md` doc coverage. Drop findings as CRITIQUE rows. **Unit 2 (conditional) — small fixes.** If the audit surfaces small drains (stale docs / missing test / inconsistent naming), ship as a bundled docs/tests commit. Larger findings spawn their own iterate tickets.
- unblocks: Surfaces the per-skill drift accumulated across 21 skill authorings. Pairs with the skills-always-land mechanic change as a natural sequencing predecessor (audit first, then mechanic shift, then re-audit).
- blocked-by: None. Audit-only.
- score: 5 × 6 / 10 = 3.0 (medium impact — audit surfaces drift but doesn't ship behaviour change; medium-high ease — pure read-walk).
- recommended-slot: pairs with the skills-always-land candidate; ship before or alongside.


### Phase 79 — General effects audit (88 buffs + debuffs)
- promoted: 2026-05-24 (nineteenth oversight; user picked the mechanic-shift bundle at Q1 — Phase 79 is the effects-audit pre-work for Phase 80; ships before the mechanic shift so per-effect drift is mapped first).
- signal: **User-flagged at oversight-18 2026-05-23.** The effects library has grown to 40 buffs + 48 debuffs = 88 effects (per `docs/effects.md` count). User wants a general audit pass — likely sniffing for inconsistency between spec / docs / actual behaviour; possible balance issues; possible orphan exports; possible test gaps. Pairs with the skills-always-land mechanics change since effects ARE what skills apply.
- scope: One audit phase, 1-2 commit units. **Unit 1 — audit.** Walk every effect in `src/Effects/effects.library.ts` (or wherever the registry lives). Produce a per-effect audit table (effect id × {type / tier / intensity / duration / payload / hermetic test coverage}). Cross-check against `specs/01-effects-engine-completion.md` + `docs/effects.md`. Drop findings as CRITIQUE rows. **Unit 2 (conditional) — small fixes.** Same shape as the skills audit candidate above.
- unblocks: Surfaces per-effect drift accumulated across 88 effects. Pairs with the skills-always-land mechanic shift — if effects always-land, the per-effect resistance + application semantics change; the audit lays the groundwork.
- blocked-by: None. Audit-only.
- score: 5 × 6 / 10 = 3.0 (medium impact + medium-high ease; same shape as the skills audit).
- recommended-slot: pairs with the skills audit + the skills-always-land candidate; can ship in parallel or as a bundle.



### Phase 80 — Skills always-land effects + separate damage roll (direction (a) pure split)
- promoted: 2026-05-24 (nineteenth oversight; user picked the mechanic-shift bundle at Q1 + locked direction **(a) pure split** at Q2 with explicit revisit-if-unbalanced caveat: "let's note somewhere this decision so if it's unbalanced, we can come back to it." The (b) intensity-scaling and (c) split-resistance variants stay in this body as fallback paths — a follow-up phase can re-author one of those over the (a) baseline if post-Phase-80 playtesting / hermetic-balance signal exposes that resistance is meaningless on the effect side.).
- signal: **User-flagged fundamental mechanics change at oversight-18 2026-05-23.** Current model: skills go through a hit-roll + resistance check (`resolveEffectApplication` in `src/Combat/`); failed roll means the effect doesn't land. User-requested model: **skills always apply their effects** (no hit roll, no resistance check on the effect-application side). If a skill also deals damage, the damage portion rolls separately AND subtracts resistances (resistance now only gates the damage half, not the effect half). This is a **load-bearing engine-mechanic shift** — affects every Tier 1 / 2 / 3 skill resolution path, the `executeSkill` engine, the `resolveEffectApplication` pipeline, the Combat resolver's stance-vs-action interactions, and every hermetic test that pins effect-application outcomes.
- scope: **DESIGN-HEAVY — wants attended oversight before promotion.** Three open design directions for the brief:
  - **(a) Pure split.** Effect-application bypasses resistance entirely (always lands). Damage rolls independently + applies its own resistance. Simplest read.
  - **(b) Effect always lands BUT intensity scales with resistance.** Effect application is unconditional but the intensity payload is reduced (or even inverted) by the target's resistance. Preserves "resistance matters" without gating application.
  - **(c) Effect always lands AND damage rolls separately AND resistances split into damage-resist vs effect-resist.** Most surgical; existing `*Resist` stats become damage-only; new effect-resist surface (per-stance? per-effect-type?) drives any application-side cap.
- unblocks: Closes a deep design tension the user has been carrying — skills "fizzle" on bad rolls in the current model, which the user finds player-experience-unfriendly. Lands a cleaner mental model for skill use ("the effect happens; the damage rolls"). Could pair with Phase 32's `critStyle` auto-selection (`double` vs `pierce`) since both touch damage-roll mechanics.
- blocked-by: Wants user-attended oversight to pick path (a) / (b) / (c) + lock the per-stat-resistance split before brief drafting.
- score: 8 × 4 / 10 = 3.2 (high impact — load-bearing engine shift; medium-low ease — many touch points + a design pass + a test sweep). Effective score should be re-weighted by user-flagged urgency at promotion time.


### Phase 81 — Walkthrough catalog expansion (Phase 65 / 66 / 68 coverage)
- promoted: 2026-05-24 (nineteenth oversight; user picked the walkthrough catalog + CLI infrastructure pair at Q1).
- signal: Phase 64 (`94b9f47`) shipped a single endgame-loadout walkthrough (Sage preset → Coastal Tyrant → bootstrap-paradox); `docs/testing.md` § "Agent-graded walkthroughs (Phase 26)" calls it "the canonical demonstration-grade example". Since Phase 64 shipped, three significant gameplay surfaces have landed without walkthrough coverage: Phase 65 (fishing-village 25-node branching grid + three sub-areas + Phase 60 befriendable placements), Phase 66 (Tier 2 synergy skills — 5 authored patterns + the `synergy-fired` event variant), and Phase 68 (per-enemy `BefriendabilityConfig` + Coastal Tyrant boss-tier befriend predicate). The walkthrough framework (`automation/scripts/walkthroughs/*.{json,goal.md}`) is the canonical demonstration channel for hand-authored gameplay; without it, recent surfaces are pinned only by hermetic unit tests + the per-feature docs. Walkthroughs let an agent grader narrate the actual player experience.
- scope: One phase, 3 commit units. **Unit 1 — fishing-village exploration walkthrough.** Authors `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/fishing-village-exploration.{json,goal.md}`: drive Apprentice preset across the 25-node map exercising the spine (`fv-1` → `fv-10`) AND at least one sub-area (Harbor District dead-end via `fv-11` → `fv-15` gull crag; OR Inland Streets loop `fv-17` ↔ `fv-19`; OR Cliff Path `fv-21` → `fv-25` gull's nest). Goal: 6 pass conditions covering map traversal, at least 4 distinct `MapEventKind` resolutions, one MournfulGull encounter (Phase 60 befriendable at fv-15) reaching either friendship or victory, and at least one `alignmentDelta` annotation fired on a Phase 43-authored pool entry. **Unit 2 — Tier 2 synergy chain walkthrough.** Authors `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/synergy-skills-chain.{json,goal.md}`: drive Wanderer preset (level 8 — meets the Tier 2 `{ level: 5 }` learning requirement) through a combat scripted to exercise at least 2 of the 5 Phase 66 synergy skills, demonstrating the predicate-match path on `resonance-bleed` or `intensity-feedback`, and pinning at least one `synergy-fired` `SkillEvent` emission. **Unit 3 — Coastal Tyrant befriend walkthrough.** Authors `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/coastal-tyrant-befriend.{json,goal.md}`: drive Sage preset (level 15 — endgame combat capacity) through a combat scripted to satisfy the Phase 68 `BefriendabilityConfig` AND-composition (heart-stance use + enemy HP ≤ 40% + 5 both-defend rounds) and reach `outcome === 'friendship'`. Goal pins the predicate-axis matrix per Phase 68 D-cases. Also extends `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/README.md` with three new inventory rows and updates `docs/testing.md` § "Agent-graded walkthroughs" to mention the new catalog.
- unblocks: Phase 65 / 66 / 68 gameplay surfaces gain demonstration-grade pins beyond unit tests. The walkthrough graders (Phase 39+40 reporter) can narrate the actual player experience for each. Future phases can mirror the pattern: every significant gameplay surface gets at least one walkthrough alongside hermetic e2e.
- blocked-by: None — all three walkthroughs target shipped surfaces.
- score: 5 × 6 / 10 = 3.0 (medium impact — catches feature-regression at the player-experience tier; medium-high ease — pure content authoring against an existing framework).
- recommended-slot: any time; independent of the befriend / Tier 3 / alignmentDelta candidates.


### Phase 82 — CLI run-loop + Codex integration (Phase 72 + 73 consumer surfaces)
- promoted: 2026-05-24 (nineteenth oversight; user picked the walkthrough catalog + CLI infrastructure pair at Q1).
- signal: Phases 72 (`store.resetRun({ keepCharacter })`) and 73 (`state.codex.unlockedEntries` + `Enemy.journalEntry`) shipped engine surfaces that the mobile UI will consume. The CLI driver (`src/CLI/game.cli.ts`) is the engine's own reference consumer — today it has tabs for map / combat / journal (quests) / skills / inventory / character / debug / save / load / quit, but no surface for either run reset OR codex viewing. The engine ships these surfaces; the CLI should demonstrate them so (a) agent-graded walkthroughs can exercise the codex / reset paths end-to-end, (b) future RN consumers have a reference rendering, (c) the engine surface gets a second consumer beyond the hermetic e2e (catches mismatches between docs and reality faster than docs-only). The existing "Journal" tab is quest-only — Codex is a sibling concept, NOT a rename per Phase 73 naming-note.
- scope: One phase, 3 commit units. **Unit 1 — CLI Codex tab.** New `codexTab(store)` function in `src/CLI/game.cli.ts` rendering `state.codex.unlockedEntries`: per entry id, look up the source enemy's `journalEntry` (title + body) and render. Empty state: "Your codex is empty — befriend a foe with a journal entry to start filling it." Add 'codex' to the Tab union + main-menu items + dispatch switch. **Unit 2 — CLI "Begin again" command.** New entry on the main menu (or a debug sub-menu) — "Begin again — full reset" (keepCharacter: false) and "Begin again — keep character" (keepCharacter: true), both dispatching `store.resetRun(opts)`. Render the post-reset hearth node id + the new runId. **Unit 3 — Walkthrough + docs.** New `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/codex-unlock.{json,goal.md}` driving Apprentice preset → MournfulGull befriend path → assert codex tab shows the unlocked entry. `docs/gameloop.md` § "game.cli.ts" subsection extended with the Codex tab + Begin again entries. `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/README.md` inventory row.
- unblocks: Phase 72 + Phase 73 surfaces gain a reference consumer + agent-graded walkthrough coverage beyond the hermetic e2e. The engine's "if you can't render it in the CLI, you can't render it anywhere" invariant stays maintained.
- blocked-by: None — Phase 72 + 73 engine surfaces are shipped. Wants the post-GH#65 content sweep candidate to ship first ONLY if the codex-unlock walkthrough wants more authored entries to exercise; otherwise the 3 authored entries (MournfulGull + HollowEyedBeggar + CoastalTyrant) are sufficient.
- score: 4 × 6 / 10 = 2.4 (medium impact — closes the reference-consumer gap + adds walkthrough coverage; high ease — CLI work is well-grooved against the existing `journalTab` pattern).
- recommended-slot: after the post-GH#65 per-foe content sweep candidate (or any time — sweep is independent).


### Phase 77 — Audit: base-action token generation (Spec 04 token economy)
- promoted: 2026-05-23 (eighteenth oversight; user-flagged suspected regression "base attack/defend may not be generating the tokens it was supposed to" — urgent enough to promote ahead of the generic audit candidates).
- source: candidate filed at expand pass 22+ (this oversight). User-flagged at oversight-18 with explicit "Audit that feature." framing.
- scope: One audit phase, 1-2 commit units. **Unit 1 — audit.** Walk `src/Combat/combat.resolver.ts` + the basic-action path (likely `scenario.ts` or sibling) + `specs/04-skills-engine.md` Q-on-basic-action-grants + the hermetic tests pinning token generation (likely in `src/Combat/e2e/` or `src/Skills/e2e/`). Produce a per-action audit table: `attack-hit` / `attack-miss` / `defend` × {spec says / code does / tests assert / drift?}. Drop findings in `plan/CRITIQUE.md` Pending as MED rows if drift exists. **Unit 2 (conditional) — fix.** If audit surfaces a real bug, patch the resolver + adjust hermetic tests; per-bug commit. If audit clears, ship a "verified" note in `plan/AUDIT.md` Done with the trail.
- unblocks: Restores trust in the token-economy contract that synergy-skill resolution (Phase 66) + multi-resource-cost skills depend on. Pre-work for the skills-always-land mechanic shift candidate (need confirmed token generation before changing skill resolution semantics).
- blocked-by: None — pure audit.
- score: 6 × 7 / 10 = 4.2 (high-medium impact + high ease).

### Phase 76 — `previewTemplateAtAllRarities` batch helper (Phase 75 follow-up)
- promoted: 2026-05-23 (eighteenth oversight; user picked this candidate at Q1 — smallest natural follow-up to Phase 75; bias-adjusted highest in pool at 5.55).
- source: candidate filed at expand pass 22 (`4826c37`).
- scope: One phase, 2 commit units. **Unit 1 — engine helper.** New `previewTemplateAtAllRarities(templateId: string, playerLevel: number, rng?: () => number): Record<ItemRarity, Equipment | undefined>` in `src/Items/item.factory.ts`. Internally calls `previewTemplateAtRarity` four times (once per `ItemRarity` value: common / uncommon / rare / unique). Returns the full record shape; `undefined` cells signal "this template can't roll at that rarity at this level". Re-exported through `src/Items/index.ts` + top-level barrel (+1 runtime export; fixture 236 → 237). Hermetic e2e at `src/Items/e2e/preview-template.engine.test.ts` extended (3 new cases): returns all-4-rarity record per template; level-too-low yields all-undefined; unique template returns only `unique` populated. **Unit 2 — docs + CHANGELOG.** `docs/items.md` Modifier-catalogue "Previewing rolled mods" subsection extended to mention the batch helper alongside the single-cell helper; `docs/api.md` Items block extended; `README.md` Items row extended; `CHANGELOG.md [unreleased] ### Added` entry; `plan/bearings.md` Items block extended.
- unblocks: Mobile item-detail / tooltip views can render the full rarity ladder per template in a single call. Pairs with the existing item-library matrix view that Phase 75 unlocks (matrix view uses the single-cell helper per cell; detail view uses the batch helper per item).
- blocked-by: Phase 75 (shipped at `d9e8a17`).
- score: 4 × 8 / 10 = 3.2 + 0.5 user-source-adjacent + 1.5× items bias = **5.55**.

### Phase 75 — `previewTemplateAtRarity` helper (mobile item-library mod-visibility)
- promoted: 2026-05-23 (seventeenth oversight; user picked this candidate to keep the loop productive post-Phase-74 + post-0.11.0 publish; AUDIT bias `equipment/items` stays armed since this is the bias target).
- source: User jot at `b5c8165` (refined at oversight-15 `077979e`); candidate filed at the same oversight. The real gap: `equipmentTemplates` (exported on `src/index.ts`) carries only `baseStatModifiers` by design — rolled mods only exist on runtime `Equipment` instances from `dropItem`. Mobile UI rendering the item-library view shows zero modifiers on every entry.
- scope: One phase, 2 commit units. **Unit 1 — engine primitive.** New `previewTemplateAtRarity(templateId: string, rarity: ItemRarity, playerLevel: number, rng?: () => number): Equipment | undefined` helper in `src/Items/item.factory.ts` (or sibling). Default `rng` to a fixed seed (e.g. `() => 0.5` per the Phase 70 Coastal Tyrant deterministic-drop pattern) so previews are reproducible per (template, rarity, level) tuple. Reuses the existing `dropItem` machinery with rng + rarity pinned. Re-exported through `src/Items/index.ts` + top-level barrel. Hermetic e2e at `src/Items/e2e/preview-template.engine.test.ts` covering: (a) returns Equipment with rolled modifiers matching the rarity tier (0/1/2/3 mods for Common/Uncommon/Rare/Unique); (b) deterministic per fixed-rng-seed; (c) returns `undefined` for unknown templateId; (d) requiredLevel-gated value-tier resolution. Public-surface fixture bump (+1 runtime export). **Alternative shape** (brief picks at dispatch): `getTemplatePreviewModifiers(template, rarity, playerLevel, rng?): RolledModifier[]` (returns just the mod list; UI composes the display). **Unit 2 — docs + CHANGELOG.** `docs/items.md` Modifier-catalogue section extended with a "Previewing rolled mods (library / catalog views)" subsection. `docs/api.md` Items block extended. `README.md` Items row extended. `CHANGELOG.md [unreleased] ### Added` entry.
- unblocks: mobile item-library view can render `equipmentTemplates` × `ItemRarity` tiers with rolled mods visible per cell. Same engine-asks-from-mobile-consumer-side pattern as GH#65 — engine exposes the typed surface, UI consumes it.
- blocked-by: None — all consumed engine surface is shipped.
- score: 5 × 6 / 10 = 3.0 + 0.5 user-source bump = 3.5; × 1.5 items bias = **5.25**.

### Phase 74 — Post-GH#65 per-foe content sweep (Phase 71 + Phase 73 missing-enemy authoring)
- promoted: 2026-05-23 (sixteenth oversight; user picked this candidate to refill the queue post-GH#65 trio drain saturation).
- source: candidate filed at expand pass 20 (commit `f892f3a`). Phases 71 + 73 each shipped content on only the 3 currently-befriendable enemies (MournfulGull + HollowEyedBeggar + CoastalTyrant) per their D1/D9 scope-tightening; the remaining 13 enemies (`enemy.library.ts` roster: TidepoolCrab, SeaMistWisp, LullabyMoth, Disatree_01, WetHound, ForestSprite, ArgumentativeCrow, TideflukeReaver, HushWraith, HollowSaint, TheDisagreement, EchoOfPyrrhonia, Sandbag_01) were named as a follow-up content sweep at both phases' Follow-ups sections.
- scope: One phase, 3 commit units. **Unit 1 — `finalBlowLines` + `causeLines` on the 13 non-befriendable enemies.** Author the 6 strings per enemy (3 variants × 2 line groups; `pactLines` only authored on befriendable enemies — see Unit 2). Voice continues from each enemy's existing `description` + Phase 45 alignment pin + Phase 49 skill rotation (where present). Sandbag_01 is a test sandbox — author trivial placeholder lines or skip per brief discretion. **Unit 2 — Identify any newly-befriendable enemies and author `pactLines` + `journalEntry` + `friendshipReward` on them.** Brief at dispatch picks 1-2 candidates from the 13 that thematically suit a befriend arc (TideflukeReaver, HushWraith, and TheDisagreement are plausible Tier-2 candidates; HollowSaint is plausible boss-tier). If the brief decides nothing else befriendable lands in this phase, Unit 2 collapses. **Unit 3 — Extend the Phase 71 + Phase 73 hermetic e2e files** with registration assertions for the newly-authored enemies; extend `docs/enemy.md` Aftermath narrative + Codex sections with the new coverage; `CHANGELOG.md [unreleased] ### Added` entry naming the per-foe additions.
- unblocks: Mobile aftermath panel renders engine-authored chronicle prose for every encounter (no presenter-derived fallback for the player-visible majority of fights). Codex tab populates as the player traverses content rather than only on the 3 befriendable encounters. Establishes the content-sweep pattern as a follow-up shape for any future per-foe surface.
- blocked-by: None. Phase 71 + Phase 73 engine surfaces are shipped; pure content authoring.
- score: 5 × 6 / 10 = 3.0.

### Phase 71 — Per-foe narrative prose for aftermath panels (GH#65 ask 1)
- promoted: 2026-05-22 (fourteenth oversight; GH#65 just filed at 5.5 — highest-scoring item in the pool; user opted aggressive triage: promote all three GH#65 asks).
- source: GH#65 (`Engine-side asks from mobile Phase 70 (aftermath modals)`, filed 2026-05-22). Mobile presenter `state/presenters/aftermath.engine.ts` currently picks from a 3-variant table keyed off damage tier — chronicle voice belongs in engine content. This phase moves the prose onto per-foe fields so the engine becomes the canonical source.
- scope: One phase, 3 commit units. **Unit 1 — engine primitive.** New optional fields on `src/Enemy/types.ts`: `finalBlowLines?: { brutal: string; quiet: string; ironic: string }` (victory final-blow chronicle, picked by damage-tier shape), `pactLines?: { quiet: string; setDown: string; heavy: string }` (friendship outcome chronicle, picked by how the parley landed), `causeLines?: { brutal: string; broken: string; quiet: string }` (defeat / cause-of-loss chronicle). Re-exported through `src/Enemy/index.ts` + top-level barrel. Fixture bump (3 new types). **Unit 2 — content authoring.** Populate the 9-line set on the authored core (CoastalTyrant + MournfulGull + HollowEyedBeggar at minimum; brief picks coverage breadth across the remaining `src/Enemy/enemy.library.ts` roster). All lines authored in the chronicle voice matching each foe's existing narrative pin. **Unit 3 — hermetic e2e + docs + CHANGELOG.** `src/Enemy/e2e/aftermath-lines.engine.test.ts` (registration + presence pins per authored enemy + line-shape guards). `docs/enemy.md` gains an Aftermath-narrative subsection. `docs/api.md` Enemy block extended. `CHANGELOG.md [unreleased] ### Added` entry.
- unblocks: mobile aftermath panels (and any future UI surface) stop owning chronicle prose. Pairs with Phase 60 / 69 friendshipReward narrative threads — same "prose belongs on the enemy" pattern, extended to victory + defeat outcomes. Future per-foe presenter work has a single typed surface to pull from.
- blocked-by: None. All shipped engine surface (Phase 60 narrative + Phase 70 boss-tier authoring) demonstrates the prose-on-enemy pattern.
- score: 5 × 5.5 / 10 = 2.75 (mobile-filed score 5.5; medium impact + high ease — pure content + typed surface; no engine math).
- mobile callsite (post-engine release): `state/presenters/aftermath.engine.ts` drops the `derive*Phrase` helpers.

### Phase 72 — Run-loop semantics (`resetRun` + `runId` + starting-hearth) (GH#65 ask 2)
- promoted: 2026-05-22 (fourteenth oversight; GH#65 ask 2 at 4.5; user opted aggressive triage to refill the queue).
- source: GH#65 (`Engine-side asks from mobile Phase 70 (aftermath modals)`, filed 2026-05-22). Mobile BEGIN AGAIN at `state/combat-mode.tsx` currently full-heals + dismisses (band-aid); the engine has no run-reset primitive, so mobile can't model death / restart / hearth re-entry cleanly.
- scope: One phase, 3 commit units. **Design-heavy — wants user-attended brief drafting at dispatch.** Open design directions for the brief: (a) starting-hearth scope — does the engine ship a default-region-hearth registry, or do regions register their own at MAP_REGISTRY init time?; (b) save-migration shape — does `runId` get added to `SaveData v?` and default for legacy saves, or does v? bump the schema?; (c) `resetRun` semantics — does `keepCharacter: true` preserve combat resources / friendshipCounter state across runs, or zero everything below the persistent character layer? **Unit 1 — engine primitive + save migration.** New `resetRun({ keepCharacter: boolean }): GameState` action on `src/Game/store.ts` (persistent character — preset / skills / equipment / philosophicalAlignment; run-scoped — currentMap / mapState / activeCombat / runtime flags). New `runId: string` field on `GameState` (UUID per run; bumped by `resetRun`). Save migration v? → v? defaults `runId` for legacy saves. **Unit 2 — starting-hearth registration.** Per-region hearth wiring (default fishing-village hearth at `fv-1`; northern-forest hearth selected when authoring goes; type shape lets future regions register their own). **Unit 3 — hermetic e2e + docs + CHANGELOG.** `src/Game/e2e/run-loop.engine.test.ts` (run-reset preserves character; clears run-state; increments runId; starting-hearth resolution per region). `docs/api.md` Game block + `docs/gameloop.md` Run-loop subsection + `CHANGELOG.md [unreleased] ### Added`.
- unblocks: mobile death/restart loop becomes mechanically modeled rather than UI-faked. Future runs-history surface (per-run XP totals, longest-survived run, etc.) has a `runId` to key off. Starting-hearth concept is the foundation for region-respawn / soul-form / equivalent run-recovery mechanics.
- blocked-by: None. All save-migration plumbing exists (Phase 51 throttling + v2/v3 migrations).
- score: 5 × 4.5 / 10 = 2.25 (mobile-filed score 4.5; medium-high impact — closes a structural gap; medium ease — design pass + 3 commit units; save-migration always wants care).
- mobile callsite (post-engine release): `state/combat-mode.tsx` BEGIN AGAIN dispatches `resetRun({ keepCharacter: true })` instead of full-heal + dismiss.

### Phase 73 — Codex / journal-entry surface on parley outcomes (GH#65 ask 3)
- promoted: 2026-05-22 (fourteenth oversight; GH#65 ask 3 at 4.0; user opted aggressive triage to refill the queue).
- source: GH#65 (`Engine-side asks from mobile Phase 70 (aftermath modals)`, filed 2026-05-22). Mobile `<CombatFriendshipPanel>` renders an optional 'A NEW ENTRY' card that never mounts because the engine doesn't expose codex entries.
- scope: One phase, 3 commit units. **Unit 1 — engine primitive.** New Codex slice on `GameState`: `codex: { unlockedEntries: string[] }` (additive; save migration defaults `[]`). New per-foe optional `journalEntry?: { id: string; title: string; body: string }` on `src/Enemy/types.ts` (brief picks between flat-string vs structured at dispatch; structured pairs better with future Codex-tab UI). New `unlockCodexEntry(entryId: string): GameState` reducer action + auto-firing wiring on `store.endCombat()` `outcome === 'friendship'` branch (after the existing items / xpBonus / narrative / flagSet / alignmentDelta threads). `CombatEndReport.friendshipReward` gains optional `codexEntryUnlocked?: { id: string; title: string }` (mirrors Phase 69 `alignmentShift` surfacing pattern). De-duped via `includes()` on `unlockedEntries`. **Unit 2 — content authoring.** `journalEntry` on the 3 authored befriendable foes (CoastalTyrant magistrate-fallen-priest chronicle; MournfulGull wistful-empathy chronicle; HollowEyedBeggar reversal-of-begging chronicle). **Unit 3 — hermetic e2e + docs + CHANGELOG.** `src/Game/e2e/codex.engine.test.ts` (unlock on friendship + de-dupe + foes without journalEntry no-op + victory outcome doesn't unlock). `docs/api.md` Game-state Codex block. `docs/combat.md` Friendship Path codex-entry note. `CHANGELOG.md [unreleased] ### Added`.
- unblocks: mobile NEW ENTRY card mounts. Future Codex-tab UI has a typed slice to read. Pairs with Phase 60 + 62 + 69 — the codex-entry-on-friendship pattern is the natural fifth thread (items / xpBonus / narrative / flagSet / alignmentDelta / **codexEntry**).
- blocked-by: None. The friendship-outcome reward-threading machinery is well-established (Phase 60 / 62 / 69 are all reference implementations).
- score: 5 × 4 / 10 = 2.0 (mobile-filed score 4.0; medium impact — unblocks a real mobile UI surface; medium ease — additive slice + content + e2e).
- mobile callsite (post-engine release): `<CombatFriendshipPanel>` NEW ENTRY card reads `report.friendshipReward.codexEntryUnlocked` and mounts when populated.

### Phase 70 — Boss-tier befriendable enemy (Coastal Tyrant content authoring)
- promoted: 2026-05-21 (thirteenth oversight; Boss-tier candidate fully unblocked post-Phase-68 + Phase-69; critique-34 row 2 scope-refresh applied here).
- source: original candidate filed at expand pass 6; refreshed at expand-17 (`8af8b28`) post-Phase-68; further refreshed at expand-18 (`7ac2b07`) after Phase 69 promotion. The scope's earlier "Optionally extend `FriendshipReward` shape with `alignmentDelta?`" hypothetical SHIPPED at Phase 69 (`a42709f` + `9b7787d`) — this candidate's role shrinks to pure content authoring against the now-complete `FriendshipReward` shape.
- scope: One phase, 2 commit units. **Unit 1 — Coastal Tyrant `friendshipReward` content authoring.** Coastal Tyrant (`src/Enemy/enemy.library.ts:317`) already carries the Phase 68 `befriendabilityConfig` (`hpGate { belowPct: 0.4 }`, `requiredStances: ['heart']`, `roundsThreshold: 5`); this unit fills in the matching `friendshipReward` field. All four `FriendshipReward` field-slots are live engine surface — pick values:
  - `items`: 2-3 guaranteed items mixing consumables + one unique equipment piece from `uniqueTemplates` (e.g. `[heart-draught, healing-potion, <unique heart-aspected equipment>]`). The brief at dispatch picks the unique piece + verifies it's reachable through the existing item factory.
  - `xpBonus: 50+` per the candidate's original framing — boss-tier rewards should feel meaningfully larger than the normal-tier MournfulGull (+10) / HollowEyedBeggar (+15).
  - `narrative`: multi-paragraph; lean on the magistrate-fallen-priest archetype (alignment `faith-pessimistic-transcendent` — Marcion / Grand Inquisitor / Ferreira). "The priest who lost his god" framing; the friendship outcome is recognition + release rather than victory.
  - `alignmentDelta`: thematic shift matching the archetype — e.g. `{ outlook: +3, scope: -2 }` (he found a way back from despair toward an individual recognition; brief-locked values at dispatch time inside the Phase 43 ±1..±5 band; the combined-axis shift is more aggressive than the normal-tier single-axis deltas, fitting the boss-tier weight).
  - `flagSet: 'befriended-coastal-tyrant'` per Phase 62 convention; unblocks dialogue / quest-content authoring downstream.
- **Unit 2 — hermetic e2e + docs + CHANGELOG.** `src/Game/e2e/befriend.engine.test.ts` Phase 70 describe block: drive the Coastal Tyrant befriend path through the Phase 68 predicate set (heart-stance log + enemy HP ≤ 40% + counter ≥ 5) AND validate the rich `friendshipReward` threads (items appear in `report.loot`; `xpBonus` adds correctly; `narrative` surfaces; `alignmentShift` reflects the per-axis delta with Phase 42 clamps; `flagSet` lands in `state.flags`). `docs/enemy.md` Befriendable-enemies table flips Coastal Tyrant from "deferred — boss-tier follow-up" → fully-authored row (items, xpBonus, alignmentDelta, narrative). `CHANGELOG.md [unreleased] ### Changed` entry. `plan/bearings.md` Enemy block needs no edit (the surface was added by earlier phases).
- unblocks: closes Phase 60's most-named follow-up + establishes the boss-tier reward-authoring pattern for the second boss (The Disagreement) + future elite-tier friendship arcs. The narrative + alignmentDelta combination demonstrates the full Phase 60 + 62 + 68 + 69 stack on a single high-stakes encounter. Pairs with the existing Coastal Tyrant Phase 49 skill rotation (`achilles-gambit`) and Phase 45 alignment pin — the boss is now narratively + mechanically + alignment-wise complete.
- blocked-by: None. Phase 68 + Phase 69 shipped all engine fields this candidate consumes; only content authoring remains.
- score: 4 × 7 / 10 = 2.8 (medium impact — closes Phase 60's headline follow-up; high ease — content-only against fully-shipped engine surface).

### Phase 69 — `FriendshipReward.alignmentDelta` extension (closes Spec 14 Q4)
- promoted: 2026-05-21 (twelfth oversight; clear-scope highest-score candidate at 3.5; no blockers).
- source: candidate filed at expand pass 17 (`8af8b28`). Spec 14 Q4 ("friendship-victory ↔ alignment cube intersection") was filed as "orthogonal by design" at Phase 58 / Phase 63; this phase resolves it.
- scope: One phase, 2 commit units. **Unit 1 — engine primitive.** Extend `FriendshipReward` with `alignmentDelta?: Partial<PhilosophicalAlignment>`; `store.endCombat()` threads the delta through `applyAlignmentDelta` on the `outcome === 'friendship'` branch (after the existing items / xpBonus / narrative / flagSet threads). `CombatEndReport.friendshipReward` gains an optional `alignmentShift?: PhilosophicalAlignment` field surfacing the post-clamp pin (mirrors how `applyDialogueChoice` returns the new cell). Hermetic coverage at `src/Game/e2e/befriend.engine.test.ts` extension (cold-cell + clamp-edge cases). Fixture bump: 162 → 163 types. Re-exports through `src/Enemy/index.ts` + top-level barrel. **Unit 2 — content + docs + CHANGELOG.** Author `alignmentDelta` on one or two existing befriendable enemies (MournfulGull's tonal pin: outlook +5 — wistful empathy; HollowEyedBeggar: scope -5 — gravity-pulls-toward-individual — exact values locked at brief time). `docs/enemy.md` Befriendable-enemies table gains an `alignmentDelta (Spec 14 Q4)` column. `specs/14-philosophical-alignment.md` Q4 flipped from "orthogonal — future" to "Resolved at Phase 69" with the shipping reference + the per-enemy authoring summary; the matching out-of-scope follow-up bullet (line 180) closed out. `CHANGELOG.md [unreleased] ### Added` entry for `FriendshipReward.alignmentDelta` + `CombatEndReport.friendshipReward.alignmentShift`. `plan/bearings.md` Enemy block updated to name the extension.
- unblocks: closes Spec 14 Q4 fully. Provides the typed surface for the Boss-tier befriendable enemy candidate's `alignmentDelta` authoring (the candidate explicitly names it as a deferred sub-scope). Future befriendable-enemy arcs get a richer reward toolkit on top of the existing Phase 60 items / xpBonus / narrative + Phase 62 flagSet machinery.
- blocked-by: None. Phase 43's `applyAlignmentDelta` helper is the canonical implementation reference (same clamp + apply pattern).
- score: 5 × 7 / 10 = 3.5 (medium-high impact — closes a long-standing spec Q + unlocks richer befriend content; high ease — additive optional field; the engine math already exists in `applyAlignmentDelta`).

### Phase 68 — Befriending mechanic v2: per-enemy `BefriendabilityConfig` (design path (a))
- promoted: 2026-05-20 (eleventh oversight; user-attended design pass picked path (a) Per-enemy `BefriendabilityConfig` out of the five filed design directions).
- source: candidate "Befriending mechanic v2 — richer than friendshipCounter capping" (filed at oversight-9 2026-05-20). The other four directions ((b) HP reverse-gate, (c) skill-driven, (d) multi-stage, (e) resource-cost) were rejected at the same oversight pass — chosen direction is most authoring-flexible AND pairs cleanly with the deferred Boss-tier befriendable enemy candidate.
- scope: One phase, 3 commit units. **Unit 1 — engine primitive.** New `BefriendabilityConfig` type in `src/Enemy/types.ts` with the shape locked at the design pass:
  ```ts
  interface BefriendabilityConfig {
    roundsThreshold?: number;
    hpGate?: { belowPct: number };
    requiredStances?: PhilosophicalStance[];
    requiredSkillUse?: string[];
    defaultFallback?: 'both-defend-cap';
  }
  ```
  Optional `Enemy.befriendabilityConfig?: BefriendabilityConfig` field. The combat resolver / `endCombat` machinery in `src/Game/game.reducer.ts` consults the config before applying Phase 36 cap semantics; when present, ALL named predicates must be satisfied for friendship eligibility (roundsThreshold counts both-defend rounds as today; hpGate requires enemy HP fraction below the threshold at the eligibility check; requiredStances requires the player to have used at least one of the named stances during combat; requiredSkillUse requires casting at least one of the named skill IDs during combat). When absent OR when `defaultFallback === 'both-defend-cap'` is set explicitly, fall through to Phase 36's `friendshipCounter` cap semantics unchanged. Hermetic e2e in `src/Enemy/e2e/befriendability-config.engine.test.ts` covers (a) field absent → Phase 36 mechanic intact; (b) hpGate enforcement; (c) requiredStances enforcement; (d) requiredSkillUse enforcement; (e) AND-composition across multiple predicates. Public-surface fixture bumps for the new type + `BefriendabilityConfig` re-export through `src/Enemy/index.ts` + top-level barrel. **Unit 2 — author one boss-tier config (validation pass).** Coastal Tyrant (boss; alignment `faith-pessimistic-transcendent`) gains a `befriendabilityConfig` per the design preview shape: `{ hpGate: { belowPct: 0.4 }, requiredStances: ['mercy'], roundsThreshold: 5 }`. Picked deliberately as the **boss-tier authoring example** because the Boss-tier befriendable enemy candidate names Coastal Tyrant as its target — Unit 2 ships the config side of that follow-up; the reward content (`friendshipReward` extension) lands in the Boss-tier candidate's phase. Extend `src/Game/e2e/befriend.engine.test.ts` with one hermetic case driving the Coastal Tyrant path through the new predicate set. **Unit 3 — docs + CHANGELOG.** `docs/combat.md` Friendship Path subsection extension documenting the config field + predicate semantics + AND-composition rule; `docs/enemy.md` "Befriendable enemies (Phase 60)" table gains a "BefriendabilityConfig (Phase 68)" column noting Coastal Tyrant's new entry; `CHANGELOG.md` `[unreleased]` ### Added entry for `BefriendabilityConfig` + ### Changed entry for Coastal Tyrant. `plan/bearings.md` Enemy block line gains `BefriendabilityConfig (Phase 68)`. `Knowledge-Gaps.md` Q5 follow-up note if relevant.
- unblocks: Boss-tier befriendable enemy candidate (currently in Pending, score 2.4, blocked-by THIS phase per oversight-9 framing). When Phase 68 lands, that candidate ships pure reward-content (extend `friendshipReward` shape with `alignmentDelta?: Partial<PhilosophicalAlignment>` + author the multi-paragraph narrative + boss-tier item rewards). The Phase 36 mechanic stays as the fallback for low-tier enemies that don't opt in.
- blocked-by: None — design pass at oversight-11 unblocked the engine primitive shape AND the first content authoring example.
- score: 6 × 4 / 10 = 2.4 (medium-high impact — unblocks the boss-tier follow-up + tightens an existing mechanic; medium ease — design call resolved, ~3 commit units of engine + content + docs work).

### Phase 66 — Tier 2 synergy skills (5 authored patterns + `whenEffectAtLeast` predicate clause)
- promoted: 2026-05-20 (tenth oversight; user-attended design pass picked the engine primitive shape AND the content scope — 4 candidates + 1 write-in variant on resonance burst).
- source: `braindump/BRAINDUMP.md` § "Combat — Tier 2 Synergy" (filed at expand pass 16 `4a266d4`); user design-pass at oversight-10 locked the directions.
- scope: Three units. **Unit 1 — engine primitive.** Per the user pick, add `whenEffectAtLeast?: { effectId: string; intensityMin?: number; durationMin?: number; on: 'caster' | 'target' }` as an optional predicate clause on existing skill payload variants (not a new payload type — smallest engine touch per the user's "Recommended" pick). The skill engine evaluates the predicate against the relevant `ActiveEffect[]` before applying the main payload; failing predicate routes to a fallback (or no-op). Co-located hermetic coverage. **Unit 2 — author 5 Tier 2 synergy skills.** All four locked-in patterns + the write-in variant:
  - **(a) Cross-stance duration amp** (braindump Example A) — a heart-stance skill that doubles a body-stance DoT's remaining duration on the target; emits bonus damage if the post-doubled duration is ≥ 5.
  - **(b) Buff type-swap: Body Thorns → Heart Bat Swarm** (braindump Example B) — a heart-stance skill that converts the caster's Body Thorns (≥5 rounds remaining) into a heart-typed `Bat Swarm` buff that heals from the remaining duration instead of reflecting damage.
  - **(c) Cross-stance intensity amp** — mind-stance skill that doubles a heart-stance buff's intensity for the remaining duration. Symmetric to (a) on the intensity axis.
  - **(d) Resonance burst** — any-stance skill that consumes an opposing-stance debuff on the target (clearing it) in exchange for damage proportional to its remaining intensity × duration. "Burn the lattice; spend it."
  - **(e) Resonance detonation** (user write-in at oversight-10) — heart-stance Tier 2/3 boundary skill that consumes the caster's full combat-resource pool AND clears all effects from both combatants, dealing massive damage equal to the sum of cleared effect (intensity × remainingDuration) plus the consumed tokens. The "essentially resetting combat back to the start" framing the user named; ship as the simpler "consume all resources + clear all effects + apply one-shot payload" semantic (combat continues from there). Heavy "rewind state to combat-start" semantics deferred as a follow-up if a future content phase wants the true rewind.
  Phase brief at dispatch fixes the per-skill stance / cost / cell mapping. **Unit 3 — hermetic e2e + docs + CHANGELOG.** Each new skill gets hermetic coverage driving `executeSkill` with seeded `ActiveEffect[]` on the combatant; `docs/skills.md` gains a "Tier 2 synergy (Phase 66)" subsection; CHANGELOG `[unreleased]` ### Added grows a Phase 66 bullet.
- unblocks: Tier 2 mechanical identity becomes "rewards stance switching" per the braindump intent. Phase 33's declared `learningRequirement: { level: 5 }` on every Tier 2 skill is now mechanically meaningful. Pairs with the (deferred) Befriending mechanic v2 design pick (c) — skill-driven friendshipCounter — if a future skill payload adds `incrementsFriendship?: number`. The resonance-detonation variant (e) establishes the "nuclear option" pattern for future Tier 3 / endgame skills.
- blocked-by: None — user design pass at oversight-10 unblocked both the engine primitive shape and the content scope.
- score: 6 × 4 / 10 = 2.4 (re-scored from the original 2.0 candidate to reflect the expanded 5-skill scope per the user write-in; ease drops slightly because resonance-detonation's effect-clearing + token-consumption thread reaches into more of the combat resolver than the simpler 3-skill scope).

### Phase 67 — CLI overview / quick-start doc (user write-in at oversight-10)
- promoted: 2026-05-20 (tenth oversight; user free-form: "Can I get an overview doc of what's been implemented and how I can test it with the CLI").
- source: oversight write-in. No prior expand candidate; first-time-filed.
- scope: One phase, pure docs. Author a new top-level `docs/quickstart.md` (or similar canonical name picked at brief time) that gives a player or developer a single-page overview of the shipped engine + how to drive the CLI to exercise each major surface. Target audience: someone landing on the repo without context. Skeleton (brief picks the final shape):
  - **What's shipped** — module-by-module bullet (Character, Combat, Effects, Items, Skills, NPCs, Game, World, Philosophy) with the 1-2 marquee features per module + phase numbers. Pulls heavily from `docs/api.md` + the CHANGELOG.
  - **How to run the CLI** — `npm run game`, the tab surface (Character / Map / Combat / Save/Load / Debug), scripted mode (`--script` / `--stdin`).
  - **Walkthrough catalog** — the 11 walkthroughs at `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/` (boss-encounter, character-sheet, item-use, map-events, save-load, shop, skill-learning, skills-in-combat, stat-allocation, endgame-loadout) with a one-line "what this exercises" each. Cross-link to the walkthrough README.
  - **Key in-game flows** — combat start → resolve rounds → end (with stance × action mechanics + Phase 36/60/62 friendship path); map exploration (Phase 23 events + Phase 65 expanded fishing-village layout); save / load round-trip; Phase 60 befriendable enemies at fv-15 + fv-18.
  - **Verify gates** — `npm run verify` / `npm run lint` / `npm test` / `npm run deploy:check`; cross-link to `docs/testing.md`.
  - **Pointers** — for engine surface use `docs/api.md`; for per-module deep dives use `docs/<module>.md`; for the canonical migration guide between engine releases see CHANGELOG.md `[unreleased]` Migration notes.
- unblocks: New-contributor discoverability. Mobile / external consumers landing on the repo have a single entry-point page instead of needing to grep multiple docs. Future user-facing release announcements can link to it.
- blocked-by: None. Pure docs work; no engine touch.
- score: 5 × 7 / 10 = 3.5 (high impact — closes the front-door-overview gap the user explicitly flagged; high ease — assembles existing material rather than authoring new substance).

### Phase 65 — Expand the fishing-village starting map ("huge first map" pass)
- promoted: 2026-05-20 (eighth oversight of the session; user write-in: "I want to make the first map considerably larger. For now it'll be the 'base' map but in the future we can start breaking it up and balancing it. For now, I just want a huge first map").
- source: oversight write-in. Replaces the candidate-promotion choice for this tick.
- scope: Significantly expand `src/World/Continents/Coastal-Village/maps.ts` `fishing-village` map from its current shape — a linear 10-node chain (`fv-1` → `fv-10` along the x-axis, each with one `connectedNodes` entry) — to a substantially larger branching map. Target: ~25-35 nodes in a 2D grid layout with multiple branches, sub-areas (harbor district / inland streets / cliff path / etc.), and 3-5 dead-end / loop branches to give exploration weight. Author `MapEventPool` entries for each new node (mix of `encounter` / `interaction` / `gathering` / `rest` / `hazard` / `loot-cache` per the existing Phase 23 8-kind taxonomy; keep `village` entries clustered in the harbor district where shops naturally live; one `cutscene` beat at a marquee location). Reuse existing enemies from `ENEMY_REGISTRY` for encounter nodes (no new enemy content this phase). Reuse existing NPCs (Old Marrow, Coastal Beggar, Tideshopkeeper) for the harbor district. **Phase brief at dispatch** picks the final node count, the layout, and the per-node event-kind assignment; this candidate's scope is "the first map should be a meaningful exploration space, not a railroad." Per the user's "base map" framing, balancing + sub-area splits are explicit follow-up phases.
- unblocks: Future content phases (per-region quest authoring, alignment-shifting content beats, befriendable enemy placements) have somewhere to land. The Northern Continent stub candidate (carried, score 3.5) becomes more meaningful as the second continent once the first is real. Establishes the per-continent layout pattern (multi-branch grid, sub-areas, mixed pool kinds) for future continents.
- blocked-by: None. All upstream primitives are live since Phase 23/24/41 (MapEvents engine + pool authoring + Spec 23 acceptance).
- score: 7 × 5 / 10 = 3.5 (high impact — the canonical playspace gets real; medium-low ease — content authoring across ~25-35 nodes is substantial, but each node is a small JSON-ish payload following existing patterns).
- recommended-slot: ship next; this is the user's directed next direction.

### Phase 61 — CHANGELOG breaking-removals backfill (mobile #93 unblock)
- promoted: 2026-05-20 (seventh oversight; user picked option 1 in response to mobile #93's 58-typecheck-error revert and explicit `### Removed` / `### Breaking` backfill request)
- source: oversight signal — mobile `axiomancer-mobile#93` comment 2 lists the undocumented breaking removals discovered when bumping the engine pin 0.10.0 → 0.10.2. Absorbs the existing critique-26 row (CHANGELOG `[unreleased]` empty post-0.10.2) into a wider scope.
- scope: Two or three units. Unit 1 — audit each tagged release `v0.7.0` → `v0.10.2` by diffing `dist/index.d.ts` (or `git show <tag>:src/index.ts`) against the prior tag, plus walking the per-phase briefs in `plan/phases/` for breaking-removal mentions. Catalogue every removal mobile flagged: `getCoastalMap`, `Encounter.enemy`, `DialogueChoice.id` / `.label`, `DialogueNode.speaker`, `Character.mana` / `.maxMana`, `ActiveEffect.id` / `.name`, `EffectStatTarget` literal-union tightening, `GameState` index signature removal — plus any others surfaced by the diff. Unit 2 — backfill `CHANGELOG.md` for each affected version with a `### Removed` / `### Breaking` block. The 0.10.0 entry already has a stub Removed block (only `WorldMap` listed); extend it. Earlier tags (`0.7.0` / `0.8.0` / `0.9.0`) get new Removed blocks where applicable. The `[unreleased]` heading also gets populated with Phase 58/59/60 + the 7 iterate fixes shipping post-0.10.2 (Phase 60's `FriendshipReward` is the only public-surface addition; the rest are docs / structure). Unit 3 — comment on mobile #93 with the canonical migration guide once the CHANGELOG lands (the `Closes #93` trailer pairs with mobile's Phase 60 re-scope; the engine repo provides the docs, mobile authors the shim sequence). Optionally re-run `node scripts/diff-public-surface.mjs v0.7.0 HEAD` (Phase 53) for the canonical per-version diff once the fixture exists at both refs (`v0.10.0` predates the fixture per the existing 0.10.1 migration note).
- unblocks: mobile #93 Phase 60 re-scope decision (single phase vs 60a..60f compatibility sequence). Closes critique-26 row. Future engine consumers (axiomancer-mobile, any future RN/web client) can trust the engine CHANGELOG as the canonical break-list.
- blocked-by: None. Pure docs work in CHANGELOG.md; no code touched. The Unit 3 mobile-comment is optional (could be a separate manual step).
- score: 7 × 8 / 10 = 5.6 (high impact — unblocks a downstream consumer; high ease — pure docs against existing git history).

### Phase 62 — Quest-branch wire-in on `outcome === 'friendship'` (Phase 60 follow-up)
- promoted: 2026-05-20 (seventh oversight; user multi-selected this as the Phase 60 D3 deferral closeout)
- source: filed at expand pass 15 (`a987340`); Phase 60 D3 deferral
- scope: Three units. Unit 1 — pick path: (a) `FriendshipReward.flagSet?: string` + extend `store.endCombat()` to dispatch a flag-set action on friendship outcome when the field is present; existing quest-entry flag gates (`DialogueChoice.requires.flag`) consume the flag downstream, OR (b) `QuestObjective.completedOn?: 'friendship' | 'victory'` slot + extend `progressQuest` / `killObjectives` to dispatch on the correct outcome label. Path (a) reuses the existing flag-gate machinery and is the smaller patch; path (b) is more expressive but adds a new field to `QuestObjective`. Brief picks (a) at dispatch. Unit 2 — author one quest entry that branches: MournfulGull's friendship sets a `befriended-mournful-gull` flag; a new dialogue branch on a fishing-village NPC (e.g. Coastal Beggar) gates on the flag and offers a different quest exit when set. Unit 3 — hermetic e2e in `src/Game/e2e/befriend.engine.test.ts` (or sibling) drives a friendship → flag-set → dialogue-gate path end-to-end. `docs/combat.md` Friendship Path section gains the flag-set semantics; `docs/api.md` notes the new field on `FriendshipReward`.
- unblocks: Friendship outcome becomes a real quest-shaping choice, not just a one-off combat exit. Closes Phase 60 D3 deferral. Enables future "this quest branches on whether you befriended X" authoring without engine work.
- blocked-by: Phase 60 (shipped). Phase 61 should land first so the CHANGELOG `[unreleased]` entry can roll the new `flagSet` field in with the other post-0.10.2 surface additions.
- score: 5 × 5 / 10 = 2.5

### Phase 63 — NPC alignment observers (Spec 14 Q2 follow-up)
- promoted: 2026-05-20 (seventh oversight; user multi-selected this alongside the Phase 60 D3 closeout)
- source: filed at expand pass 15 (`a987340`); Spec 14 Q2 deferral
- scope: Three units. Unit 1 — extend `NPC` type with `observesAlignment?: boolean` (default `false` / undefined treated as opt-out); add a per-NPC `lastSeenAlignmentCellId?: string` field to the `state.flags` or a sibling state map (writes on every `applyDialogueChoice` to an observing NPC). Unit 2 — extend the dialogue runtime so reactive branches can gate on `playerAlignmentCellChangedSince?: string` (predicate against the cached cell id) — same shape as the existing `requires.flag` slot; opt-in per dialogue choice. Unit 3 — author 1 NPC that observes: Old Marrow is the natural pick (already carries alignment-gated dialogue per Phase 43+46). Add a dialogue branch that surfaces if the player's alignment has visibly shifted since the last conversation. Hermetic e2e drives a shift → re-converse → new branch path.
- unblocks: Spec 14 Q2 closes (engine surface exists; per-NPC adoption is content-author work). NPCs become reactive to player philosophical drift, not just gating. Future content phases can wire any NPC into the same observer machinery without engine work.
- blocked-by: Phases 42-46 (shipped). Independent of Phase 60 / 62 follow-ups.
- score: 4 × 5 / 10 = 2.0

### Phase 64 — CLI demonstration of endgame equipment × stats × combat interactions
- promoted: 2026-05-20 (seventh oversight; user write-in candidate — "Enhance CLI to demonstrate interactions between 'endgame' equipment, stats, and combat")
- source: oversight write-in (no prior expand candidate)
- scope: Two or three units. Unit 1 — author a new agent-graded walkthrough at `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/endgame-loadout.{json,goal.md}` that scripts a maxed-out character (level ≥10, stat-allocation maxed, equipped with a full unique-item set + a Phase 54 set-bonus loadout, learned Tier 3 skills) through 1-2 elite or boss encounters. Uses the existing Phase 20 `--script` / `--stdin` primitives so it's hermetic-adjacent (the walkthrough is agent-graded, not hermetic per `docs/testing.md`; it lives in `automation/` not `src/`). Unit 2 — extend `src/CLI/` debug commands (or add a new one) to fast-track a character to the endgame state for ad-hoc exploration; primary audience is dev/playtest. Optional, depends on existing CLI surface. Unit 3 — extend `docs/testing.md` § "Agent-graded e2e harness" with the new walkthrough's entry; cross-link to `docs/equipment.md` "Set Items (Phase 54)" + `docs/skills.md` Tier 3 surface. The phase's *purpose* is demonstration / playtest pre-1.0; it does NOT add new engine surface. Hermetic coverage stays in `src/<Module>/e2e/`; this phase produces a non-hermetic walkthrough.
- unblocks: Playtest readiness for the endgame loop's interactions (unique items × set bonuses × stat thresholds × Tier 3 skills × boss-tier alignment AI). Surfaces any unintended interactions before they bite during content authoring. Establishes the agent-graded-walkthrough pattern for high-level character states (the existing walkthroughs cover early-game flows: shop, save/load, item-use, skill-learning).
- blocked-by: None. All depended-on engine surfaces are live (Phase 54 set items, Phase 33 Tier 3 skills, Phase 45 boss alignment, Phase 49 enemy skill caster path).
- score: 5 × 5 / 10 = 2.5

### Phase 58 — `specs/14-philosophical-alignment.md` — conversation-loop spec for the Phase 42-46 alignment cube
- promoted: 2026-05-20 (sixth oversight of the session; build-plan queue empty after Phase 55/56/57 shipped; user multi-selected three candidates with Spec 14 prioritised as the smallest, blocks-nothing pure-docs unlock that also drains the only pending CRITIQUE row)
- source: filed at expand pass 14 (`d6f42f0`); critique-18 row (commit `c62702e`)
- scope: One phase, 2-3 commit units. Unit 1 — file `specs/14-philosophical-alignment.md` using the `specs/00-how-to-use-specs.md` template. Goal section names the 3-axis cube + 27-cell registry. Current state section cites Phase 42 (engine), 43 (alignmentDelta authoring surfaces), 44 (sourcedFromCell + fallacies-as-spells), 45 (enemy alignment + outlook bias), 46 (AlignmentGate). Open questions section captures the four remaining design calls per the critique row: (1) Should `moralMeter` unify into the cube as a 4th axis? (2) Should alignment shifts propagate to NPCs that observe the player? (3) Should there be alignment-gated endings? (4) How does the alignment cube intersect with the friendship-victory mechanic? Acceptance checklist boxes for each shipped surface point at the commit that shipped it. Unit 2 — add a row to `specs/README.md` Recommended order pointing at the new spec (Spec 14 ships **DONE** since the engine is live; the spec is documentation, not greenfield work). Unit 3 — answer any of the 4 open questions where the answer is already implicit in shipped code (e.g. Q4 friendship-victory: orthogonal — `moralMeter` shifts but `philosophicalAlignment` is unaffected since none of the 27 cells carries an alignmentDelta tied to friendship-counter resolution). On ship, drain the critique-18 row from `plan/CRITIQUE.md` Pending → Done.
- unblocks: critique-18 row drains. Future alignment phases have a centralised Q&A surface to extend. Closes the symmetry gap with every other multi-phase mechanic.
- blocked-by: None. Pure docs work; can ship in parallel with content/engine phases.
- score: 4 × 8 / 10 = 3.2.

### Phase 59 — Docs gap audit + drain (re-scoped from older Docs-sweep candidate)
- promoted: 2026-05-20 (sixth oversight; user multi-selected with explicit "re-scope down to current pending only before promotion" guidance — the original candidate's 9-row-group signal has largely drained through May 19-20 iterate ticks)
- source: filed at expand pass 11 (`ce88559`) as "Docs sweep — drain pending CRITIQUE.md rows (Phase 34 mirror)"
- scope: One phase, audit-first. The original candidate listed 9 row-groups (a-i): (a) docs/api.md Philosophy entry, (b) README.md + bearings.md Philosophy row, (c) docs/npcs.md alignmentDelta, (d) docs/skills.md requiresAlignment, (e) docs/effects.md count drift, (f) Spec 23 acceptance Phase 43 line, (g) docs/morality.md philosophy cross-link, (h) specs/14 spec-gap (now Phase 58), (i) older items (Spec 03/05e acceptance, PhilosAxiosDoc placement, TODO(spec-09), Phase 37 sell-price exploit, shop walkthrough, Phase-11 walkthroughs, automation/ README, getCoastalMap). Many shipped via /iterate across May 19-20 (CHANGELOG, docs/api.md Phase 54 backfill, scripts/README.md, DURABLE_ACTIONS reframe). At phase-brief time the brief re-audits CRITIQUE pending + recent AUDIT Done + a fresh grep of each row-group's expected text to identify residual drift; ships whatever remains as commit-per-row units (target ≤4 units). If the re-audit finds zero residual, the phase ships as a single audit-summary commit listing each row-group with shipping reference + "no residual" verdict, then closes.
- unblocks: Confirms the docs queue is genuinely drained (or surfaces what's left). Future critique passes start from a low baseline.
- blocked-by: None. Independent of Phase 58 (which removes row-group (h)) and Phase 60.
- score: 3 × 9 / 10 = 2.7 (re-scoped down from 4.8 nominal because most of the original signal has drained; high ease because audit-first means worst case is a single closing commit).

### Phase 60 — Befriendable-enemy content arc
- promoted: 2026-05-20 (sixth oversight; user multi-selected as the content-arc direction; closes Knowledge-Gaps Q5 fully — Phase 36 shipped the mechanics half, this phase ships the content half)
- source: filed at expand pass 8 (`aff5a57`)
- scope: Pick 2-3 enemies from `src/Enemy/enemy.library.ts` and author per-enemy friendship narrative — a `friendshipReward?: Reward` (or similar) field on `Enemy`, optional dialogue lines surfaced via a new `combat:befriended` MapEvent / dialogue hook, and quest entries that branch on `outcome === 'friendship'` vs `'victory'` for at least one quest. Example targets: `MournfulGull` (befriend → unique passive), `HollowEyedBeggar` (befriend → moral arc tie-in via beggar quest), one boss-tier enemy where the choice is genuinely costly. Hermetic e2e drives one befriend run end-to-end and asserts the per-enemy reward + the quest branch. Phase brief at dispatch time picks the final enemy set + reward shape; the `friendshipReward` field shape is a phase decision.
- unblocks: Knowledge-Gaps Q5 closes fully. Friendship becomes a real player choice with content stakes, not just a mechanical exit. Establishes the pattern other enemies can opt into.
- blocked-by: None. Phase 36 wired the mechanics; this is content + a small typed-surface addition.
- score: 5 × 6 / 10 = 3.0.

### Phase 55 — PersistenceAdapter ergonomics (Phase 50 follow-up)
- promoted: 2026-05-20 (fifth oversight of the session; user picked the smallest mobile-unblocking follow-up as the top priority post-0.10.1-publish — closes the last loose end of the GH#64 engine handoff)
- source: filed at expand pass 11 (`ce88559`)
- scope: One phase, 1-2 units (carried verbatim from the candidate). Unit 1 — read the mobile-side local re-declaration of `PersistenceAdapter` in `axiomancer-mobile/state/persistence/asyncStorageAdapter.ts` and diff against the engine export in `src/Game/persistence/types.ts`; identify the specific friction (method-signature granularity, generics escape hatch, error-typed return, etc.); land the engine-side change that makes the local re-declaration unnecessary. Unit 2 — extend the public-barrel hermetic test to assert the `PersistenceAdapter` export shape matches what mobile expects (mobile-side signature as source-of-truth, copied as a comment block). Documented in CHANGELOG.md as the first entry on the next `[unreleased]` heading post-0.10.1 publish.
- unblocks: Mobile's `state/persistence/asyncStorageAdapter.ts` can `import type { PersistenceAdapter } from 'axiomancer-mechanics'` instead of re-declaring locally. Future persistence-adapter consumers inherit the ergonomic surface.
- blocked-by: Phase 50 (shipped). Best paired with the 0.10.1 publish if mobile is going to bump immediately after — the PersistenceAdapter change can land as `0.10.2` or fold into a single bump.
- score: 3 × 6 / 10 = 1.8.

### Phase 56 — CI verify-on-PR / verify-on-push (GitHub Actions)
- promoted: 2026-05-20 (same oversight as Phase 55; user multi-selected three candidates including this one as the CI-gap closure)
- source: filed at expand pass 13 (`b011acb`)
- scope: One phase, 1-2 units (carried verbatim from the candidate). Unit 1 — author `.github/workflows/verify.yml` running on `pull_request` + `push` against `main`. Steps: Node setup (LTS), `npm ci`, `npm run verify`, `npm run deploy:check`. Cache `node_modules` keyed off `package-lock.json` sha. Unit 2 (optional) — extend to a release workflow on tag push (`v*.*.*`) that runs verify + builds dist + prepares a draft `npm publish` (without auto-publishing; user-triggered per RELEASING.md). The release workflow pairs cleanly with Phase 52's flow.
- unblocks: Future human contributors / branch experiments get a remote red-CI signal. README can carry a CI badge.
- blocked-by: None. Independent of Phase 55 / 57.
- score: 4 × 7 / 10 = 2.8.

### Phase 57 — Enemy rotation content sweep (Phase 49 follow-up)
- promoted: 2026-05-20 (same oversight as Phase 55 + 56; user multi-selected this as the highest-scored content authoring direction)
- source: filed at expand pass 8 (`aff5a57`)
- scope: Two units (carried verbatim from the candidate). Unit 1 — author one thematic skill per remaining elite (Tidefluke Reaver, Hush-Wraith, Hollow Saint) + remaining boss (The Disagreement) + unique (Echo of Pyrrhonia) — 5 enemies. Skills picked from `skillLibrary` so engine + tests stay green; alignment cell guides the pick (e.g. Hollow Saint faith-mid-transcendent → `pascals-wager`; The Disagreement mind-aspect → `liars-echo`). Pair each with the corresponding `philosophicalAspect` so the stance dispatch in `pickEnemySkill` reads as in-character. Unit 2 — author rotations for 2-3 selected normal enemies whose alignment-fallacy mapping is thematically tight (Mournful Gull heart → `appeal-to-pity`; Hollow-Eyed Beggar heart → `pascals-wager`); leave simple enemies (Tidepool Crab, Sea-Mist Wisp, Lullaby Moth) without skills since early-game pacing benefits from straight basic-action enemies. Hermetic e2e extends the existing Phase 49 rotation tests; `docs/enemy.md` Phase 49 subsection table grows to cover the new rotations.
- unblocks: Combat depth lever from Phase 49 actually reaches the library. The `applyOutlookBias` (Phase 45) + `pickEnemySkill` (Phase 49) interaction starts producing visible per-encounter variety.
- blocked-by: None. Pure content authoring against shipped Phase 49 + Phase 45 engine surfaces.
- score: 5 × 7 / 10 = 3.5.

### Phase 52 — Release process artifacts (CHANGELOG.md + RELEASING.md)
- promoted: 2026-05-19 (fourth oversight of the day; build-plan queue empty after Phase 51 shipped; user picked release-engineering as the highest-leverage refill since 0.10.0 was just tagged with no in-repo artefacts and mobile's upgrade doc had to be hand-reconstructed)
- source: filed at expand pass 9 (`d4bcc86`) as "Release process artifacts — CHANGELOG.md + RELEASING.md"
- scope: One phase, 2 units (carried verbatim from the candidate). Unit 1 — author `CHANGELOG.md` at the repo root following Keep-a-Changelog conventions; back-fill entries for each shipped tag (`0.2.0` through `0.10.0`) using the phase briefs as the per-tag source; each entry carries Added / Changed / Removed sections + a short "Migration notes" line for shapes that need a consumer schema migration (e.g. 0.10.0's `state.philosophicalAlignment` field for Phase 42 + the `getCoastalMap` removal at iterate `b85f509`). Unit 2 — author `RELEASING.md` documenting the tag → `npm publish` flow: (a) pre-release checklist (verify gate green, deploy:check passes, build-plan Status block has no `[ ]` rows blocking), (b) version bump + tag procedure, (c) `npm publish` step, (d) post-publish: append to CHANGELOG.md + downstream-consumer note. Both files referenced from `README.md`. Extend `scripts/deploy-check.mjs` with a "latest git tag matches CHANGELOG top heading" assertion. Pair-able with the Deprecation lifecycle candidate (still Pending) as an optional Unit 3.
- unblocks: 0.10.1 republish (pending Phase 50 + 51 changes — currently the engine sits with mobile-breaking deltas not yet published). Future engine→mobile bumps stop requiring hand-written upgrade docs. 0.11.x / 1.0.0 cuts have a checklist.
- blocked-by: None.
- score: 5 × 8 / 10 = 4.0.

### Phase 53 — Public-surface snapshot artifact + diff tool
- promoted: 2026-05-19 (same oversight as Phase 52; user multi-selected both release-engineering candidates for promotion)
- source: filed at expand pass 11 (`ce88559`)
- scope: One phase, 2-3 units (carried verbatim from the candidate). Unit 1 — author `scripts/snapshot-public-surface.mjs` that walks `dist/index.d.ts` and emits a stable JSON (`dist/.public-surface.json` or `scripts/public-surface.expected.json`) listing every exported name + kind + an arity-or-shape hint. Stable sort + deterministic JSON. Unit 2 — extend `scripts/deploy-check.mjs` with a post-build assertion that re-runs the snapshot and compares against the committed fixture; fail the gate on drift. Unit 3 — `scripts/diff-public-surface.mjs <ref-A> <ref-B>` that pretty-prints Added / Removed / Changed between two git refs. Pairs cleanly with Phase 52's CHANGELOG generation (the diff feeds the per-version bullets).
- unblocks: Mobile upgrade docs stop being hand-reconstructed. Engine public-surface drift surfaced at deploy-check time. Phase 50's hand-maintained barrel test is subsumed for surface drift (still keep it as the runtime smoke).
- blocked-by: Phase 52 is the natural prior (the snapshot feeds the CHANGELOG); could ship in parallel but the integration story is cleaner if 52 lands first.
- score: 5 × 6 / 10 = 3.0.

### Phase 54 — Spec 05e Set items (implementation)
- promoted: 2026-05-19 (same oversight as Phases 52 + 53; user picked path (a) "promote to phase" on the AUDIT `[needs-user-call]` row that the corrective-drain iterate `eb807a0` surfaced)
- source: `specs/05e-set-items.md` (spec authored pre-loop; no engine/library/tests/docs ever shipped — only `Equipment.setMembership?: string` stub at `src/Items/types.ts:199`). Promotion replaces the AUDIT `[needs-user-call]` row.
- scope: One phase, 3-4 units. Unit 1 — author `SetBonus` + `ItemSet` types in `src/Items/set.types.ts`; new export block in `src/Items/index.ts` + top-level `src/index.ts`. Unit 2 — implement `getActiveSetBonuses(character): SetBonus[]` in `src/Items/set.engine.ts`; thread set bonuses through `initializeCombat` (combatStartTokens additive stacking per Spec 05e Goal) + `generateBasicActionResources` (set generationBonus entries). Unit 3 — author 3 initial sets in `src/Items/set.library.ts` (Wanderer's Road is the Spec 05e reference; pick 2-3 base templates that thematically pair with the existing equipment library). Unit 4 — hermetic e2e in `src/Items/e2e/sets.engine.test.ts` (per-clause coverage of the Spec 05e acceptance checklist) + `docs/equipment.md` "Set Items" section. The build plan row was `[skipped]` post-corrective-drain at iterate `322227a`; flips to `[ ]` at phase-brief generation.
- unblocks: Spec 05e acceptance checklist (currently 0/8). The "Reserved for late-game" comment on `Equipment.setMembership` becomes live. Future content authoring (Spec 05c+ equipment templates) can carry set memberships.
- blocked-by: None. Pre-1.0 (0.10.x) permits the engine-side type additions without ceremony.
- score: 4 × 6 / 10 = 2.4 (mid-tier content authoring; not blocking mobile but a real spec gap).

### Phase 50 — Engine handoff for `axiomancer-mobile` (skillLibrary re-export + types.d.ts emission fix)
- promoted: 2026-05-19 (oversight; build-plan queue empty after Phase 49 shipped; user picked cross-repo unblock as the highest-leverage candidate)
- source: `axiomancer-mobile/docs/engine-team-handoff-2026-05-16.md`; filed at expand pass 8 (`aff5a57`) by oversight `e300b8d`
- signal: 3 mobile phases gated on the engine release (`axiomancer-mobile/plan/AUDIT.md` `[needs-engine-release]` row); mobile pinned `axiomancer-mechanics: "0.7.0"` exact. Verified in local working tree: Issue 1 — `grep skillLibrary src/index.ts` returns 0 hits; Issue 2 — `find dist -name types.d.ts` returns only 3 of 9 expected sub-paths. Issue 3 already shipped (`PersistenceAdapter` on barrel).
- scope: Two units. Unit 1 — add `export { skillLibrary, getSkillById } from './Skills';` to `src/index.ts` Skills block + hermetic public-barrel-import test in `src/test-utils/e2e/` asserting both symbols resolve to non-undefined at runtime. Unit 2 — investigate why `types.d.ts` is missing from 6 of 9 `dist/` sub-paths (Combat / Effects / Skills / Game top-level / Character / Enemy / NPCs / World top-level); likely cause is a tsconfig `include` mismatch between working sub-paths (Items / Game/persistence / World/MapEvents) and the missing ones. Apply the fix; verify `find dist -name "types.d.ts" | wc -l` returns 9+; add a smoke assertion (or `scripts/deploy-check.mjs` extension) that pins the count so the regression can't recur silently. Version bump + npm publish lands as a separate user-triggered step after verify is green.
- unblocks: 3 mobile phases (mobile Phase 16 [skipped], candidate 21, candidate 24); the mobile autonomous loop progresses further after the engine bump. Also resolves the broader latent type-emission risk for any external TypeScript consumer.
- blocked-by: None.
- watch: mobile's `axiomancer-mechanics: "0.7.0"` exact pin needs a manual bump after `npm publish`; mobile audit row needs a manual flip after that bump.
- score: 6 × 7 / 10 = 4.2

### Phase 51 — Autosave throttling per Spec 09 Q4
- promoted: 2026-05-19 (oversight; user pick from the older candidate tail — only the code-only candidate of the three was promoted; Northern Continent + befriendable-enemy stay pending as content-arc work that wants user-led design direction)
- source: standing `TODO(spec-09)` comments at `src/Game/store.ts:203` + `src/Game/game.reducer.ts:138`; filed at expand pass 6 (`48a57b7`)
- signal: The TODO has stayed open across ~26 phases since Spec 09. Saves are cheap today (nullAdapter no-op; node.adapter writes a single JSON), but the React Native AsyncStorage consumer (spec.md Primary consumer) will hit the backend on every action. Pre-emptive plumbing before mobile starts shipping save / load surface.
- scope: Pick path (B) restrict-by-action-type — only autosave on a curated set (`COMBAT_ROUND`, `LEVEL_UP`, `END_COMBAT`, `MOVE_TO_NODE`, `APPLY_DIALOGUE`, `SAVE_GAME`); UI-tier actions like prompt navigation never trigger writes. Deterministic policy a reader can audit; action list maps to durable game-state changes anyway. Path (A) time-throttle (`debounce(adapter.save, 500ms)`) considered and rejected at promotion — risks losing the last ~500ms on a crash and is less audit-friendly. Hermetic e2e drives the store through a sequence of actions and counts `adapter.save` invocations across both UI-tier and durable actions.
- unblocks: Pre-emptive readiness for the React Native AsyncStorage backend (paired with the Phase 50 engine handoff so the mobile consumer hits the engine with both fixes already in place). Drains two standing TODO comments. Closes Spec 09 Q4.
- blocked-by: None. Pure store-layer change. Independent of Phase 50; can ship after.
- score: 4 × 6 / 10 = 2.4

### Phase 49 — Enemy-skill caster path (combat depth)
- promoted: 2026-05-19 (oversight; build-plan queue was empty after Phase 48 shipped)
- source: Phase 38 brief's named follow-up direction + Spec 07 elite/boss progression gap; filed at expand pass 7 (`5b37528`)
- signal: Phase 38 brief explicitly named this as the next direction: "the skill caster is always the player in this codebase (`skill.engine.ts` takes a `player: Character` param; there is no `executeSkill(caster: …)`). Future enemy-skill work would change this, but it's not a Phase 38 concern." Spec 07 acceptance says the enemy AI dispatches between `attack` / `defend`; today's `decideEnemyAction` does exactly that and ignores any `skills?: string[]` on Enemy. Elite + boss enemies feel mechanically thin because every fight resolves on the same two verbs. The `learnSkill` + `getAvailableSkills` surface from Phase 30 already exists; this is the symmetric application path. The Phase 45 outlook-bias AI hook is the natural place to read alignment + pick a skill once the caster path is generic.
- scope: Three units. Unit 1 — refactor `executeSkill` to take a `caster: Combatant` and `target: Combatant` (today: `player + enemy` positional args + `targetType: 'self' | 'enemy'` flag). Unit 2 — extend `decideEnemyAction` to optionally pick a skill from the enemy's `equippedSkills` when affordable; route through the (now agnostic) `executeSkill`. Author 1-2 elite / boss enemies with a skill rotation (e.g. Coastal Tyrant gets `argument-from-authority` per spec 04b; pair with the Phase 45 alignment pin so the skill pick reads as in-character). Unit 3 — hermetic e2e drives an enemy-skill-fired round through `resolveCombatRound`; `combat:round` event carries the per-skill `SkillPhaseEvent` for the enemy actor. Update `docs/enemy.md` + `docs/skills.md`.
- unblocks: Combat depth lever. Spec 07 elite / boss progression becomes mechanically distinct. The `ActiveEffect.sourceId` wiring from Phase 38 starts paying off (enemy debuffs now have a real caster). The Phase 44 fallacy-as-spell library starts to read from the enemy side too. Future feature: per-enemy skill libraries by tier.
- blocked-by: None — every prerequisite (Phase 30 learnSkill, Phase 35 Character.id, Phase 38 sourceId wiring, Phase 44 fallacy library, Phase 45 enemy alignment) has shipped.
- score: 6 × 4 / 10 = 2.4 (high value; medium effort because the refactor touches the executeSkill signature + every call site in the resolver path).

### Phase 46 — Alignment-gated content (`requires.alignment` on dialogue + skill learning)
- promoted: 2026-05-16 (oversight; promote-multiple sequence Phase 46/47/48 after the 42-45 follow-up arc closed)
- source: expand pass 7 candidate, filed at `5b37528`; Phase 42 brief Follow-ups
- signal: Phase 42-45 shipped the cube + payloads + enemy pins; nothing gates *content access* on alignment yet. Same-shape extension of the existing `DialogueChoice.requires.flag` and `SkillLearningRequirement.level` gates. Closes the "alignment is observable / payloadable / enemy-side / gates" four-corner triangle.
- scope: Three units. Unit 1 — extend `DialogueChoice.requires` with `requiresAlignment?: { axis, op: 'gte' | 'lte', value: number }`; `visibleChoices` filters by player's `philosophicalAlignment`. Unit 2 — extend `SkillLearningRequirement` with the same shape; `meetsLearningRequirement` checks it. Unit 3 — author 2-3 alignment-gated dialogue branches on Old Marrow / Coastal Beggar + 1-2 alignment-gated Tier 3 skills. Hermetic e2e drives each gate path. Update `docs/philosophy.md` "Authoring gates" subsection.
- unblocks: Makes the cube's mechanical reach asymmetric — different alignments unlock different content.
- blocked-by: Phases 42-45 (all shipped). No code-level prerequisites.
- score: 6 × 5 / 10 = 3.0

### Phase 47 — Knowledge-Gaps acceptance sweep (mirror Phase 41's spec-sweep pattern)
- promoted: 2026-05-16 (oversight; promote-multiple sequence)
- source: expand pass 7 candidate, filed at `5b37528`
- signal: `Knowledge-Gaps.md` carries 25 numbered questions. ~14 entries are either (a) deliberately deferred combat-tuning (Q1/Q2/Q4/Q6) or (b) resolved by shipped phases but never marked. Same drift Phase 41 unit 4 drained for Q15/Q17-Q20.
- scope: One pure-docs phase, 3-4 commit units. Walk every numbered question, classify into deferred / resolved-not-marked / genuinely-open. For resolved entries, write "**Resolved at <spec / phase> (<hash>).**" with shipping references. For new open + actionable entries, file iterate rows.
- unblocks: Knowledge-Gaps.md becomes navigable again. Future critique passes have a cleaner signal floor.
- blocked-by: None. Pure documentation work.
- score: 4 × 8 / 10 = 3.2

### Phase 48 — Effect runtime: apply `statModifiers` + intensity scaling to derived stats (KG Q8 / Q9)
- promoted: 2026-05-16 (oversight; promote-multiple sequence)
- source: expand pass 7 candidate, filed at `5b37528`
- signal: KG Q8 says "the combat math never aggregates `statModifiers` onto the character's stats" and Q9 asks whether they should scale with intensity. The effects JSON authors `statModifiers` payloads on ~66 effects but the runtime never sums them onto `Character.derivedStats` outside the existing `rollModifier` / `defenseModifier` paths. Phase 44 `debuff_no_true_scotsman` (`physicalDefense -2`) sits in this gap.
- scope: Two units. Unit 1 — extend / add `getEffectiveStats(character)` to fold active-effect `statModifiers[]` into derived stats, scaled by intensity when `intensityScalesStatModifiers?: boolean` is set. Thread every `derivedStats` read site through the new helper. Unit 2 — hermetic e2e for buff / debuff stat-modifier effects + intensity scaling. Update `docs/effects.md` Payload Field Reference. Closes KG Q8 + Q9.
- unblocks: Activates ~66 authored `statModifiers`-bearing effects. Phase 44 fallacy debuffs become mechanically real.
- blocked-by: None. Independent of Phases 42-45; can ship after 46 + 47 or interleave.
- score: 6 × 5 / 10 = 3.0

### Phase 43 — Alignment-shifting authoring sweep on existing MapEvent + dialogue content
- promoted: 2026-05-16 (oversight; top-scoring candidate after Phase 42 ship)
- source: Phase 42 (`bdfda00`) Follow-ups #1, filed at expand pass 6 (`48a57b7`)
- signal: Phase 42 shipped the `philosophicalAlignment` engine + 27-cell library + `SHIFT_PHILOSOPHICAL_ALIGNMENT` action but explicitly deferred wiring the new axes into any existing choice payload. Without it, the alignment cube is invisible during play — the CLI Character tab renders the cell, but the cell never moves.
- scope: Three units. Unit 1 — type-extend the MapEvent + dialogue choice payload shapes with `alignmentDelta?: Partial<PhilosophicalAlignment>` and thread it through `resolveMapEvent` + `applyDialogueChoice` (mirrors the existing `moralDelta` path). Unit 2 — author first-pass alignment deltas across `src/World/Continents/Coastal-Village/maps.ts` and the Old Marrow / Fishing Village dialogue trees. Calibrate magnitudes to the same `±1..±5` band moralMeter uses; defining `±10` choices reserved for endgame. Unit 3 — hermetic e2e drives a fishing-village walk through a known-alignment-shifting choice and asserts the cell moves; refresh `docs/philosophy.md` with an "Authoring deltas" subsection.
- unblocks: Makes the alignment cube observable in actual play. Sets the authoring vocabulary for every future map / dialogue beat that wants to shift philosophical position.
- blocked-by: None. Phase 42 shipped every engine prerequisite.
- score: 6 × 7 / 10 = 4.2

### Phase 44 — Fallacies-as-spells / abilities (Phase 42 content payoff)
- promoted: 2026-05-16 (oversight; promote-multiple Phase 42 follow-up sequence)
- source: `PhilosAxiosDoc.pdf` closing line + Phase 42 Follow-ups, filed at expand pass 6 (`48a57b7`)
- signal: PDF closes "could serve as 'spells' or abilities in your RPG system." Phase 42 shipped the 27 cells with all 81 fallacies stored as `AlignmentFallacy[3]` per cell, but explicitly stored-not-surfaced. `bearings.md` tonal commitment ("Enemies are embodiments of logical fallacies. Effect names reference philosophical paradoxes") is now backed by 81 named fallacies sitting unused.
- scope: Pick a small N (6-8 marquee fallacies — one or two per axis-pair) and ship them as the first batch of philosophical skills + effects. Each fallacy becomes either a Tier 3 skill payload (`src/Skills/skill.library.ts`) or a status-effect payload (`src/Effects/effect.library.ts`), with a cross-link to the originating `philosophicalAlignmentCell` it was sourced from (new `sourcedFromCell?: string` field on `Skill` / `Effect`). Only fallacies whose mechanics map cleanly to existing combat primitives ship in this phase; the more abstract ones (e.g. "Begging the Question") defer to follow-ups. Hermetic e2e drives one such skill through `resolveCombatRound`; one such effect through `applyEffect`. Update `docs/skills.md` + `docs/effects.md`.
- unblocks: Closes the loop from `PhilosAxiosDoc.pdf` to live combat. Future enemy authoring can pick fallacies per-cell to express philosophical archetypes.
- blocked-by: Phase 43 (the authoring sweep) ideally lands first so authored alignment deltas plus the new fallacy skills both contribute to player-facing philosophical depth in the same playtest pass.
- score: 7 × 5 / 10 = 3.5

### Phase 45 — Enemies-by-alignment AI tuning
- promoted: 2026-05-16 (oversight; promote-multiple Phase 42 follow-up sequence)
- source: `bearings.md` Visual & tonal defaults + Phase 42 Follow-ups, filed at expand pass 6 (`48a57b7`)
- signal: `bearings.md`: "Enemies are embodiments of logical fallacies. Effect names reference philosophical paradoxes." Phase 42 made philosophical alignment a first-class state field but Enemy carries no equivalent. The tonal commitment is rhetorical, not mechanical. Spec 07 elite/boss progression feels mechanically thin (every enemy resolves on the same attack/defend verbs); pinning each enemy to a cell unlocks per-archetype behaviour without a full AI rewrite.
- scope: Two units. Unit 1 — add `philosophicalAlignment?: PhilosophicalAlignment` (optional) to `Enemy`; backfill every authored enemy in `src/Enemy/enemy.library.ts` with a cell pin (e.g. Coastal Tyrant = `faith-pessimistic-transcendent` / Grand Inquisitor archetype; Tidepool Crab = `mid-mid-individual`). Unit 2 — `decideEnemyAction` accepts an optional alignment-tuner that biases the basic-action choice by outlook (Pessimistic → bias defend / friendship-stall; Optimistic → bias attack). Hermetic e2e pins the bias delta against `mockSequentialRng`. Update `docs/enemy.md` with the alignment field + cell taxonomy.
- unblocks: Makes the alignment cube readable from the *enemy* side too. Pairs with Phase 44 (player philosophical payloads) so the philosophical layer cuts both ways.
- blocked-by: Phase 42. Sequenced AFTER Phase 44 so the player-side payload library exists before enemies start drawing from it for archetype expression.
- score: 5 × 6 / 10 = 3.0

### Phase 41 — Specs + Knowledge-Gaps acceptance sweep
- promoted: 2026-05-16 (oversight; top-scoring candidate)
- source: critique pass 15 (commit `1772f30`) Spec 23 row, plus walk
  of the rest of the spec tree turning up the same drift at Spec 04
  (skills engine) and Spec 10 (moral meter) — every acceptance box
  in those three specs is still `[ ]` despite the surfaces having
  shipped (Phase 09 + Spec 04 + 04b; Phase 10; Phases 23 / 24 / 25 /
  31 / 37). `Knowledge-Gaps.md` Qs 15 / 17 / 18 / 19 / 20 are
  stale-resolved.
- summary: One commit per spec (3 commits) — tick every acceptance
  box with the commit hash that shipped it (mirror Phase 34 unit 5
  at `specs/06-*.md`). Update Spec 23's type sketches (`:95`, `:138`)
  with the Phase 37 `shop?: ShopInventory` field + a 12th acceptance
  line for the shop extension. One additional commit retires
  Qs 15 / 17 / 18 / 19 / 20 in `Knowledge-Gaps.md` with the same
  "resolved at <phase>" treatment Q5 / Q12 already got. Pure docs;
  no code touched.
- acceptance: every acceptance box in Specs 04 / 10 / 23 is `[x]`
  with a commit hash; Knowledge-Gaps.md Qs 15 / 17 / 18 / 19 / 20
  carry a resolution annotation; the critique-15 Spec 23 row moves
  from Pending to Done.
- score: 5 × 8 / 10 = 4.0

### Phase 40 — Prior-run diff in agent verify report
- promoted: 2026-05-16 (oversight; recommended-slot pairing)
- source: oversight self-critique of Phase 39 (2026-05-16, shipped at
  `602da33`); the report-to-report delta is the single most valuable
  signal an agent could read, and the prior JSON is already on disk
  at `automation/last-verify-report.json`. The Phase 39 brief deferred
  this as out-of-scope; Phase 40 closes that gap.
- summary: Before writing the new report in
  `automation/agent-vitest-reporter.mjs#writeJson`, read the prior
  report at the same path (if present + schema-compatible). Compute a
  `diff: { addedTests, removedTests, flippedToFail, flippedToPass,
  durationDeltaSlowest5 }` field on the rollup. Surface a "Changes
  since last run" section in the markdown block when the diff is
  non-empty. Bundle the Phase 39 self-critique AUDIT MED 5.4 row
  ("top-level `failures[]` flat list in JSON") into this phase so the
  agent-verify JSON schema settles in one pass rather than churning
  across multiple iterate ticks.
- acceptance:
  - Reporter reads the prior `last-verify-report.json` if present
    and schema-compatible; degrades gracefully (`diff: null`) on
    missing file or incompatible schema.
  - Rollup carries `diff: { addedTests, removedTests, flippedToFail,
    flippedToPass, durationDeltaSlowest5 } | null`.
  - Rollup also carries `failures: [{file, name, message, location}]`
    (the bundled AUDIT MED row).
  - Markdown block includes a `### Changes since last run` section
    when the diff is non-empty; nothing rendered when `diff: null`.
  - Hermetic e2e covers: fresh diff against a fabricated prior, no
    prior file (writes report, `diff: null`), and incompatible-schema
    prior (logs warning, `diff: null`).
  - `docs/testing.md` Phase-39 subsection extended with the diff
    schema; `plan/phases/phase_39_agent_verify_report.md` Follow-ups
    block updated to mark the prior-run-diff item shipped.
- score: 6 × 6 / 10 = 3.6

### Phase 39 — Agent-friendly hermetic e2e report
- promoted: 2026-05-16 (oversight; user-flagged "I want a brief overview
  of the findings whenever an agent runs the hermetic e2e")
- source: oversight free-form request. Today an LLM agent running
  `npm run verify` has to scrape Vitest's default reporter output to
  understand what was tested and what failed. A structured report makes
  agent-driven verification (and human eyeballing) self-service.
- summary: Custom Vitest reporter that emits a structured agent-readable
  report after every run. Two outputs from one reporter:
  - JSON file at `automation/last-verify-report.json` —
    `{ rollup: { total, passed, failed, skipped, durationMs, slowest5,
    newFailures }, files: [{ path, status, durationMs,
    tests: [{ name, status, durationMs, failure? }] }] }`.
  - Markdown summary on stdout at end of run — totals, per-file rollup,
    failed-assertion list (file:line + message), slowest 5 tests.
  - New `npm run verify:agent` script (additive — `verify` stays
    unchanged per Hard Rule 9 conservatism); reporter lives at
    `automation/agent-vitest-reporter.ts` (TS, run via `tsx`).
- acceptance:
  - `npm run verify:agent` returns the same exit code as `npm run verify`.
  - `automation/last-verify-report.json` exists post-run with the schema
    above; a hermetic unit test pins the shape against synthetic Vitest
    Reporter events.
  - Stdout includes a clearly-delimited markdown summary block (e.g.
    `## Verify summary` … `## End summary`).
  - Markdown lists every failed test (`file:line — message`) and the
    slowest five passing tests.
  - At least one call-out heuristic implemented (e.g. "tests added since
    last report" or "files with no tests" — pick one in /plan-a-phase).
- design decisions captured upfront:
  - audience: both — JSON file + markdown stdout (user pick).
  - hook point: custom Vitest reporter (user pick — Vitest's Reporter
    API provides onTestFileResult / onFinished cleanly).
  - additive script: new `verify:agent`, do not modify the existing
    `verify` to avoid breaking the deploy gate's expectations.
- open in /plan-a-phase:
  - exact JSON schema (field names, optional vs. required).
  - which call-out heuristic ships first (added-tests-since-last-run
    requires diffing against a previous report file; "longest test in
    each file" is simpler).
  - markdown delimiter convention so agents can pluck the block out
    of stdout reliably.
- score: 5 × 7 / 10 = 3.5

### Phase 38 — `ActiveEffect.sourceId` wiring for player-applied effects
- promoted: 2026-05-16 (oversight; user pick from expand pass 4)
- source: `/expand` candidate (pass 4); Phase 35 follow-up. The Phase 35
  row noted that no combat / skill path currently sets
  `ActiveEffect.sourceId` to the player's id when the player applies an
  effect; the only in-repo setter is `equipment.reducer.ts` using
  `item.id` correctly. With `Character.id` now stable (Phase 35), the
  attribution wiring becomes mechanical.
- summary: Audit every `applyEffect` call site on the combat / skill
  path — `src/Skills/skill.engine.ts:447` (rebound effects),
  `src/Combat/resist.ts:57/82/94` (crit / rebound / overwhelmed),
  `src/Combat/effects.ts:113` (extended buffs),
  `src/World/MapEvents/handlers.ts:163` (map-event effects). Thread
  `sourceId` from the attacker's `id` (player) or `enemy.id` into each
  ActiveEffect creation. Extend `ApplyEffectOptions` with
  `sourceId?: string` so callers don't have to spread it manually.
  Hermetic e2e pins that a player-applied DoT carries
  `sourceId === state.player.id` through save / load.
- acceptance: every ActiveEffect produced on the combat / skill path
  carries a non-empty `sourceId`; new hermetic test asserts
  player-applied DoT round-trips its `sourceId` through save / load;
  no behaviour change for existing tests.
- score: 4 × 6 / 10 = 2.4

### Phase 37 — Shop economy via `village` MapEventKind
- promoted: 2026-05-16 (oversight; user pick from expand pass 3 — top score)
- source: `/expand` candidate (pass 3); `docs/items.md` Pending lists shop
  economy; `spec.md` 6-month horizon names "shops" explicitly; Phase 23's
  `village` MapEventKind has been waiting for a transactional partner.
- summary: `buyItem(character, inventory, itemId, price)` +
  `sellItem(character, item, price)` reducers (pure — decrement / increment
  `Character.currency`, add / remove items). Wire into the `village`
  MapEventHandler so resolving a `village` node opens a shop UI in the
  Map tab. Author 1-2 starter shop inventories (reuse `consumableLibrary`
  for the demo pool). Hermetic e2e covers buy / sell / insufficient-funds.
- acceptance: `Character.currency` becomes a meaningful resource — quest
  rewards that grant currency are spendable; `village` nodes are no
  longer flavour-only. New tests assert buy decrements currency + adds
  item, sell does the reverse, insufficient currency returns the
  character unchanged.
- score: 6 × 7 / 10 = 4.2

### Phase 36 — Friendship victory reward (XP + narrative tag)
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight; user pick from expand pass 3 — gameplay bias)
- source: `/expand` candidate (pass 3); Knowledge-Gaps Q5; Spec 06 Q2
  backfill confirmed friendship-counter exits report as `'flee'` and
  grant 0 XP today.
- summary: Route the friendship-counter exit through a `'friendship'`
  outcome in `determineCombatEnd` (currently reports `'flee'`); have
  `endCombat` grant `floor(enemy.xpReward * 0.5)` XP on that path;
  surface `outcome: 'friendship'` on the `combat:ended` event payload.
  CLI transcript distinguishes "befriended" from "fled".
- acceptance: the friendship test in `combat.resolver.test.ts:60-78`
  asserts `determineCombatEnd` returns `'friendship'` (the resolver
  already supports the literal) and `endCombat` grants `xpReward * 0.5`;
  CLI report differentiates befriend vs flee. Knowledge-Gaps Q5 and the
  Spec 06 Q2 follow-up close.
- score: 5 × 7 / 10 = 3.5

### Phase 35 — `Character.id` field for stable identity
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight; user pick after Phase 34 promotion)
- source: `/expand` candidate; Knowledge-Gaps Q12. The engine has
  `Enemy.id` but no `Character.id`; `ActiveEffect.sourceId` is
  loosely typed and can't unambiguously point at the player.
- summary: Add `id: string` to `Character` (auto-generate via
  `randomUUID()` unless caller provides) and propagate through
  `createCharacter`, `buildCharacterFromPreset`, and
  `characters.mock.ts`. Audit `ActiveEffect.sourceId` call sites —
  when the player applies an effect, set it to the character's id.
- acceptance: every `Character` instance constructed by the engine
  carries a non-empty `id`; `ActiveEffect.sourceId` is the player's
  id for player-applied effects; hermetic tests pin stable identity
  across save/load. Closes Knowledge-Gaps Q12.
- score: 5 × 6 / 10 = 3.0

### Phase 34 — Docs sweep
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight; user pick after critique pass 9)
- source: not a `/expand` candidate — bundled directly from 7
  doc-quality findings in `plan/CRITIQUE.md` Pending after passes
  7-9. User opted to ship as one phase (commit-per-finding) instead
  of having `/iterate` chew through them tick-by-tick.
- summary: 7 commit units (one per finding) — docs/gameloop.md
  GameEvent surface, docs/character.md Pending section,
  docs/api.md Phase 25-30 additions, Spec 06 backfill answers,
  Spec 06 + 12 acceptance checklists,
  automation/scripts/walkthroughs/README, docs/items.md.
- acceptance: each shipped unit moves its corresponding critique row
  Pending → Done. `grep -c "deferred" specs/06-*.md` drops; Spec 06
  + 12 acceptance boxes show at least one `[x]`.

### Phase 33 — Tier 2 / Tier 3 skill content polish
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight; user pick after critique pass 7)
- source: `/expand` candidate (pass 2); the 6 mid-late skills in
  `src/Skills/skill.library.ts` ship placeholder numbers; the Resonance
  Pairs design from `braindump/BRAINDUMP.md` was never wired into the
  payloads.
- summary: Balance + flavour pass on the 6 tier-2 + tier-3 skills.
  Tier 2 = mixed-stance gates, Tier 3 = mind + philosophical-token
  gates per braindump Option C. Author 3-4 line flavour text per
  skill. Update `docs/skills.md`.
- acceptance: every Tier 2 / Tier 3 skill in `skill.library.ts` has a
  non-placeholder description, resource costs reflect the Resonance
  Pairs vision, and `docs/skills.md` documents the progression model.

### Phase 32 — `critStyle` auto-selection (`double` vs `pierce`)
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight; user pick after critique pass 7)
- source: `/expand` candidate (pass 2); Knowledge-Gaps Q3 left
  `CritStyle` invisible — every crit uses the default.
- summary: Compute both crit paths in
  `src/Combat/phases/scenario.ts` and pick the higher. Hermetic test
  pins the choice for a divergent stat-set. Update `docs/combat.md`
  + `docs/effects/README.md` LIVE flags.
- acceptance: a stat-set where `double` and `pierce` diverge produces
  the higher damage; docs no longer flag the mechanic as "genuinely
  open".

### Phase 31 — CLI mapTab progression fix
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight; surfaced from CRITIQUE pass-7 HIGH at 4d020f2)
- source: critique-7 HIGH — Phase 23's `resolveMapEvent` only writes
  `discoveredNodes`; `mapTab` filters by `availableNodes`, so the
  player gets stuck at fv-2.
- summary: Extend `resolveMapEvent` to add post-resolve adjacents to
  `availableNodes` (drop them from `lockedNodes`). Hermetic e2e walks
  fv-1..fv-4. Revise the save-load walkthrough to use the now-
  reachable fv-3 step.
- acceptance: `availableNodes` includes the next adjacents after each
  node resolves; the apprentice can reach fv-4 from fv-1 in three
  moves; save-load.json walks fv-2 → save → fv-3 → load → fv-2.

### Phase 30 — Runtime skill learning
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight; surfaced from Spec 06 backfill at 75f250b)
- source: Spec 06 Q7 backfill — discovered there is no `learnSkill`
  function and skills are only assigned at character-creation time via
  the preset, even though `learningRequirement` typing already exists
  in `src/Skills/types.d.ts`.
- summary: Add `getAvailableSkills(character)` filter +
  `learnSkill(character, skillId)` reducer respecting
  `learningRequirement`. Surface unlocks during level-up; CLI Character
  tab gets a "Learn skill" prompt. No modal blocking — sit-and-spend
  model parallel to Phase 29.
- acceptance: hermetic e2e proves eligibility filter, learn-once
  invariant, and level-up unlock surfacing. Walkthrough confirms the
  CLI affordance.

### Phase 29 — Stat allocation flow
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight; surfaced from Spec 06 backfill at 75f250b)
- source: Spec 06 Q3+Q8 backfill — discovered the proposed
  `availableStatPoints` field never landed on `Character`, and
  `applyLevelUps` only touches level / HP / threshold.
- summary: Add `availableStatPoints` + `STAT_POINTS_PER_LEVEL = 3`,
  grant points on level promotion, ship an `allocateStatPoint` reducer
  + Character-tab UI. Deferred allocation per Spec 06 Q8(B) so the
  scripted-walkthrough harness (Phase 26/27) keeps working.
- acceptance: hermetic e2e proves the multi-level cascade keeps
  granting points, allocation decrements + re-derives stats; CLI
  Character tab surfaces an Allocate prompt only when points are
  available.

### Phase 28 — Backfill open-Q answers in shipped specs
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight; user pick after Phase 27 unit 3 shipped)
- source: `/expand` candidate; signal from
  `grep -c "> Your answer:$" specs/*.md` showing 19 blanks across four
  shipped specs (`01`, `06`, `10`, `12`) — decisions made during the
  build but never written back.
- summary: One commit per spec (4 commits). For each open question,
  read the shipped code in the corresponding `src/<module>/` and write
  a 1-2 sentence answer capturing the actual decision. Pure docs work
  — no code, no test changes. The template (`00-how-to-use-specs.md`)
  keeps its blank as intentional.
- acceptance: `grep -c "> Your answer:$" specs/01-*.md
  specs/06-*.md specs/10-*.md specs/12-*.md` returns 0 across the four
  files; the `00-` template still has its instructional blank. Each
  answer line cites or quotes the relevant code surface so a future
  reader can verify against ground-truth.

### Phase 27 — Expand walkthrough coverage
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight; user pick after Phase 26 shipped)
- source: oversight free-form — "author more Phase 26 walkthroughs"
- summary: Ship scripted walkthroughs + goal companions for the four
  remaining named Phase 26 surfaces (skills-in-combat, save/load,
  item use, debug spawn / boss encounter). RNG-dependent paths use
  the agent-grading layer's tolerance for variability — the goal
  files specify what the agent should accept as "the goal happened
  at least once" rather than pinning exact outcomes.
- acceptance: `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/` contains 6 paired
  files (`<surface>.json` + `<surface>.goal.md`) covering all six
  named surfaces; each walks through `npm run agent-e2e` end-to-end
  with a meaningful goal definition.

### Phase 25 — Remove legacy `processNode` + MapEvent types
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight)
- source: Phase 24 scope deviation (deferred from Spec 23 Q7)
- summary: Delete `src/World/process-node.ts`, the `MapEvent` and
  `MapEventType` types, the `nodeEvents` field on `MapDefinition`,
  and the `npc` / `shop` kinds. Rewrite the ~10 `processNode`-pinned
  cases in `src/World/e2e/world.engine.test.ts` to drive
  `resolveMapEvent` instead. Strip legacy exports from the world
  barrel and `src/index.ts`.
- acceptance: `grep -rn "processNode\|MapEvent\b\|MapEventType" src/`
  returns zero hits; world e2e suite green using only the new dispatcher.

### Phase 26 — Validation CLI + agent-graded automation harness
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight; user-flagged "most important phase")
- source: oversight free-form request — "I can't be sure anything is
  fully implemented [from the CLI alone]. I want to bridge that gap."
- summary: Expand `src/CLI/game.cli.ts` to cover the full engine
  surface (skills in combat, one-keypress next-map-node, character
  sheet view, per-decision state-log writer behind `--state-log <path>`).
  Rework automation testing: one scripted walkthrough per CLI surface
  + a companion `*.goal.md`; new `automation/agent-e2e.mjs` runs the
  walkthrough with `--script + --json-events + --state-log`, captures
  the log, and pipes (goal, log) to Claude API for a structured
  pass/fail. Hermetic vitest suite stays as-is; agent-grading is a
  deliberately non-hermetic layer on top.
- acceptance: every CLI tab and prompt has a corresponding walkthrough
  + goal in `automation/scripts/walkthroughs/`; `npm run game --
  --script <path> --json-events --state-log <path>` produces a JSONL
  log; `node automation/agent-e2e.mjs <script> <goal>` returns a
  structured pass/fail decision.

### Phase 15 — Split combat.resolver.ts into per-phase helpers
- promoted: 2026-05-14 (oversight)
- source: critique pass-1 (Z-MED 2.1 in AUDIT.md)
- summary: Extract `resolveRoundStart`, `resolveActionRestriction`,
  `resolveAdvantage`, `resolveStanceEffects`, `resolveScenario`,
  `resolveRoundEnd` into colocated files; orchestrator stays as
  `resolveCombatRound`. Public contract unchanged.

### Phase 16 — Migrate sibling tests into `src/<Module>/e2e/`
- promoted: 2026-05-14 (oversight)
- source: critique pass-1 (Z-LOW 1.2 in AUDIT.md)
- summary: Move `*.test.ts` files in Effects/Enemy/Utils/World/Character/NPCs
  into `<Module>/e2e/<feature>.engine.test.ts`. Mechanical; no logic changes.
- decision: chose "migrate" over "broaden bearings".

### Phase 17 — Unify CLI surface
- promoted: 2026-05-14 (oversight, user request)
- source: oversight (CLI testing harness initiative)
- summary: Drop `combat`, `character`, `auto:combat` scripts; delete
  `combat.cli.ts`, `character.cli.ts`, `automation/combat-test.py`. Single
  entry: `npm run game`. Combat reached via Map encounters and the Spawn
  Encounter tab from Phase 19.

### Phase 18 — Preset character roster
- promoted: 2026-05-14 (oversight, user request)
- source: oversight (CLI testing harness initiative)
- summary: `src/Character/preset-roster.ts` with ≥4 progression tiers
  (`fresh-L1`, `mid-L5`, `late-L10`, `endgame-L15`). Roster picker at boot.
  Hermetic e2e validates each preset's internal consistency.

### Phase 19 — Enemy spawn picker
- promoted: 2026-05-14 (oversight, user request)
- source: oversight (CLI testing harness initiative)
- summary: Spawn Encounter debug tab — list enemies by tier, pick one,
  drop into combat against the active preset.

### Phase 20 — Scripted / agent-driven CLI mode
- promoted: 2026-05-14 (oversight, user request)
- source: oversight (CLI testing harness initiative)
- summary: `--script <path>` (JSON plan, deterministic replay via Phase 11
  RNG), `--json-events` (structured stdout for LLM agent parsing), stdin
  one-action-per-line mode for live agent control.

### Phase 21 — Phase 12 API cleanup
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight)
- source: critique pass-2 (4 MED findings in CRITIQUE.md, commit 4c04ae8)
- summary: Drain the four cleanup findings against Phase 12's just-shipped
  public surface so the package API stabilizes in one pass:
  1. Remove `createNodeAdapter` re-export from `src/index.ts:130` and
     `src/Game/index.ts:32` — keep it only on the `./node` subpath. Decide
     `PersistenceAdapter` interface placement (likely keep on core barrel
     for RN consumers building their own adapter; document in `docs/api.md`).
  2. Extend `events.types.ts` / `events.utils.ts` to cover the three missing
     GameEventType values (`dialogue:applied`, `game:saved`, `game:loaded`)
     with payload types, creators, and type guards — or document an
     intentional partial-coverage rename of `TypedGameEvent`.
  3. Either retrofit engine emit sites to route through the seven
     `create*Event` helpers (so engine payloads always match the typed
     shape) or downgrade them from Beta to a clearly-labelled
     "consumer convenience" tier in `docs/api.md`.
  4. Strip redundant `as Payload` casts from the seven creators in
     `src/Game/events.utils.ts` so TypeScript enforces literals against
     the return type.

### Phase 22 — Story content authoring infrastructure
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight, user request)
- source: oversight (story content workflow)
- priority: low (user explicitly noted)
- summary: Three-skill authoring surface, separate concerns, each writing
  into the existing `content/` tree (user already moved overview into
  `content/story/` and seeded `content/locations/<name>/` folders).
  - Extend `skills/story-spec.md` to be story-building-only — plot beats,
    quest arcs, "Order of Events"-style sequences. Outputs into
    `content/story/<beat-or-arc>.md`.
  - Add `skills/world-spec.md` — world / location / region / faction /
    lore. Outputs into `content/locations/<location>/<aspect>.md` (e.g.
    `content/locations/northern-forest/overview.md`).
  - Add `skills/character-spec.md` — character synopsis, backstory, voice,
    relationships, moral arc. Outputs into
    `content/characters/<character>.md`.
  - All three skills run in **dual mode**: socratic Q&A live in chat
    when invoked AND a structured spec form the user can answer offline.
    Mirror the live + spec pattern already used by `skills/story-spec.md`.
  - Add `content/templates/{character,location,story}.md` skeletons each
    skill writes from.
- design decisions captured:
  - location: `/content/` (user-moved, commit 84afc5c/ca75dcb).
  - separate templates per concern (decided).
  - separate skills per concern (decided); full creative control on shape.
  - dialogue authoring: keep inline in NPC TS modules (Old Marrow
    pattern in `src/NPCs/named/old-marrow.ts`); revisit if the catalogue
    surface grows beyond a handful of named NPCs.

### Phase 23 — MapEvents engine + node discovery
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight, user request)
- source: oversight (MapEvents implementation)
- priority: medium (user wants implementation to begin)
- summary: New spec `specs/13-map-events.md`; replace `processNode` with a
  single `resolveMapEvent(node, state): { state, event }` dispatcher; add
  node-discovery / fog-of-war mechanic.
- taxonomy (final, per user decision):
  - **encounter** — combat
  - **interaction** — dialogue / story trigger (folds old `npc` kind)
  - **gathering** — resource collection (writes inventory directly)
  - **rest** — recovery / heal
  - **village** — settlement scene; merchants / shopkeepers folded under
    village interactions (folds old `shop` kind)
  - **cutscene** — non-interactive story beat
  - **hazard** — environmental damage / status trigger
  - **loot-cache** — fixed-pool inventory grant
- migration: drop `kind: 'npc'` and `kind: 'shop'` from
  `src/World/process-node.ts:45-46` and rewrite `src/World/spec08.test.ts`
  assertions accordingly.
- node discovery (central mechanic):
  - Nodes start locked / blacked out.
  - A node becomes revealable only when an adjacent node has been
    completed (entered + its MapEvent resolved).
  - The MapEvent type is **rolled from a weighted pool at unlock time**,
    not authored per-node. Author surface is a per-region (or per-tag)
    event-pool definition.
  - All MapEvents are **one-shot** — consumed once resolved; the node
    remains traversable but produces no further events.
- additional event types worth exploring in the spec (not committed):
  shrine (save point / minor stat boon), puzzle (skill check), monument
  (lore reveal / story flag).
- e2e: hermetic test covers discover → unlock → roll → resolve →
  one-shot exhaustion across at least three event types.

### Phase 24 — MapEvents content
- promoted: 2026-05-15 (oversight, user request)
- source: oversight (MapEvents implementation)
- summary: With the Phase 23 engine in place, populate at least one node
  of each MapEvent type and migrate the existing fishing-village and
  northern-forest world content into the new shape. Hermetic e2e walks a
  short discovery → resolution chain end-to-end against the live content
  registry.

### Candidate: Dependency maintenance sweep
- signal: AUDIT.md Pending carries 2 LOW findings: zustand 5.0.13 → 5.0.14 patch update (score 2.7) and vitest 3.2.4 → 3.2.6 minor update (score 2.4). With the project post-Phase-108 and critique queue quiet, accumulated dependency updates suggest a maintenance phase. `npm outdated` likely surfaces additional safe updates beyond the AUDIT findings.
- scope: One phase, 2 commit units. **Unit 1 — dependency audit.** Run `npm outdated` to identify all available updates. Update package.json dependencies following iterate guidelines: patch updates (zustand 5.0.13 → 5.0.14), minor updates within same major version (vitest 3.2.4 → 3.2.6), and any other safe maintenance updates. Run full verify gate (`npm run type-check && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build`) to ensure no regressions. **Unit 2 — CHANGELOG + AUDIT drain.** Add CHANGELOG [unreleased] ### Changed entry documenting dependency updates. Mark AUDIT.md zustand and vitest findings as resolved in Done section with commit reference.
- unblocks: Keeps project dependencies current with latest patches and minor updates. Reduces technical debt accumulation and ensures access to bug fixes and performance improvements in dependencies.
- blocked-by: None — pure maintenance work with no engine changes.
- score: 4 × 7 / 10 = 2.8 (medium impact — maintenance debt reduction, security patches; high ease — routine dependency updates following established verify gate).
- recommended-slot: any time — independent maintenance work.

## Deferred

### Candidate: Non-combat encounter minigames (design conversation — flagged at oversight-26)
- deferred: 2026-06-05 (T direct oversight order: defer non-combat minigames).
- reason: This is a design-heavy gameplay-system conversation, not a ready `/march` phase. Keep parked until a user-attended minigame design pass defines encounter kinds, resolution rules, alignment/resource integration, CLI reference rendering, and walkthrough grading.

### Candidate: Second continent content expansion
- deferred: 2026-06-05 (T direct oversight order, reaffirming 2026-06-01 decision).
- reason: Base mechanics stabilization remains higher priority. Do not auto-promote under `/march` or `/expand`; revisit only when T explicitly reopens the Phase 100/second-continent direction.

## Rejected

### Candidate: Combat Scaling Mechanics Investigation
- rejected: 2026-06-06 (oversight, attended; Q1 user pick "Reject all 3, file real thread"). Premise contradicted by evidence. The candidate (expand-33, score 4.0) claimed "level 15+ enemies uncalibrateable — 0% win rates persist even with body=1, fundamental combat formula limitations." Phase 121's OWN closeout ledger (`automation/playtest/BALANCE_LEDGER.md` tail) reports the opposite: Normal L15 anchor 23/25 wins, Difficult L18 anchor 8/25 wins (in 25-50% band), aggregate 56/75 = 74.7%, verdict "mechanics sound for this gate", and explicitly "No core mechanics changes made." Re-verified by a live re-run at this oversight (`npm run playtest` against `sage-anchor-normal.json` → 23/25 wins / 92% / enemy final HP ~12; `sage-anchor-difficult.json` → 8/25 wins / 32% / 0 timeouts). The "~2300 HP / 50-round timeout / 0% win" state describes an intermediate exploration during Phase 121, not the landed scaffold. No core-mechanics investigation warranted. The real remaining thread (friendship/nonlethal expressiveness on lethal anchors) was filed as a fresh Pending candidate at this oversight.

### Candidate: Health Formula Rebalancing for High-Level Encounters
- rejected: 2026-06-06 (oversight, attended; Q1 user pick "Reject all 3, file real thread"). Same contradicted premise as the Combat Scaling Investigation candidate above. The "level 15 enemy maintains ~2300 HP even with body=1, 50-round timeouts across all policies" claim is false against current code: the live re-run at this oversight shows the L15 normal anchor (audit-sentinel) resolving at 92% wins with enemy final HP ~12 and avg 40 rounds (cap 55). HP derivation does not wall high-level encounters. No rebalancing phase warranted.

### Candidate: Damage Calculation Audit for Level Scaling
- rejected: 2026-06-06 (oversight, attended; Q1 user pick "Reject all 3, file real thread"). Same contradicted premise. The claim "damage scaling insufficient for level 15+ enemy defeat... all policies fail to achieve kills within 50 rounds" is false: both anchors resolve by lethal damage in-band at this oversight's live re-run (avg damage-to-enemy 367 normal / 339 difficult; avg rounds 40 / 25). Damage scaling is adequate for the canonical anchors. No audit phase warranted.

### Candidate: Character module RNG stubbing fix
- rejected: 2026-06-11 (oversight Q3 — T pick: "Yes — reject it"). The underlying AUDIT finding (Character module RNG stubbing gap) was already resolved via /iterate drain at commit 6abd897 — tests updated with mockSequentialRng() calls and proper afterEach() cleanup. No phase-level work remains. Candidate was filed before /iterate completed the drain.

### Candidate: Character presets deprecation schedule cleanup
- rejected: 2026-06-02 (oversight-28; Q1 user write-in: "remove phase item about presets. I'm trying to remove them"). The user is removing the deprecated Character presets directly, so the candidate is superseded by hands-on work. The underlying critique-46 MED ("presets deprecation schedule contradicts live use") was already drained at iterate `841d9ae` ("Character presets deprecation schedule updated"). No autonomous phase warranted — the preset-removal decision and execution sit with the user.

### Candidate: Phase 97 `previewStatAllocation` export documentation
- rejected: 2026-06-02 (oversight-28; resolved-by-iterate drift cleanup). The candidate's docs gap was closed by iterate: `d46bfbd` ("docs(character): add previewStatAllocation to API documentation") + plan drain `755e767` ("iterate finding resolved — previewStatAllocation documented"). The matching critique-46 MED row drained at the same time. Stale Pending candidate surfaced + cleared per the Phase 105 Glanton Nexus guardrail (§6.5 stale-row reconciliation). No work remains.

### Candidate: Modifier catalogue (Spec 05d)
- rejected: 2026-05-30 (twenty-sixth oversight; already shipped). expand-26 filed this as an "unstarted spec" but Spec 05d is fully implemented: acceptance checklist all `[x]`; `src/Items/modifier.catalogue.ts` defines all 7 slot pools + `uniqueModPool`; `rollModifiers`/`resolveModifiers` in `src/Items/item.factory.ts`; `modifier.types.ts` exports `HiddenModRarity`/`ModValueTier`/`ModifierPayload`/`Modifier`; hermetic coverage in `src/Items/e2e/modifier.catalogue.engine.test.ts`. No work remains. End-to-end verification of the modifier system is folded into the rescoped Phase 98 audit (Unit 1).

### Candidate: Set items system (Spec 05e)
- rejected: 2026-05-30 (twenty-sixth oversight; already shipped at Phase 54). expand-26 filed this as an "unstarted spec" but Spec 05e shipped at Phase 54 (commits `0cb4b2a` + unit 2/3): acceptance checklist all `[x]`; `src/Items/set.types.ts` (`SetBonus`/`ItemSet`), `src/Items/set.engine.ts` (`getActiveSetBonuses` + siblings), 3 sets in `set.library.ts`, combat-start token stacking + generation-bonus chaining + combat-scoped passives all wired, hermetic coverage in `src/Items/e2e/sets.engine.test.ts`. End-to-end verification of set bonuses is folded into the rescoped Phase 98 audit (Unit 2).

### Candidate: BattleLogEntry contract validation
- rejected: 2026-05-30 (twenty-sixth oversight; already shipped as Phase 96). Duplicate of the AUDIT GH#74 row; shipped at Phase 96 commit `27b5815` (defensive validation in `resolveCombatRound` + `buildBattleLogEntry`; `battlelogentry-contract.engine.test.ts`). No work remains.

### Candidate: Deprecation lifecycle policy
- rejected: 2026-05-20 (expand pass 14; superseded by Phase 52)
- reason: The candidate's Unit 1 scope (codify the deprecation lifecycle in `RELEASING.md` — mark `@deprecated`, ship a CHANGELOG `Deprecated` entry, wait at least one minor bump, remove with a CHANGELOG `Removed` entry) shipped verbatim at Phase 52 unit 2 (commit `be955b2`) as the "Deprecation lifecycle" section in `RELEASING.md`. WorldMap + getCoastalMap are cited there as past examples of the lifecycle. The candidate's optional Unit 2 (`scripts/deploy-check.mjs` scan for `@deprecated` JSDoc tags + warn-line) is forward-looking-only: `grep -rn "@deprecated" src/` returns 0 hits today, so the scan would be empty and the deploy-gate output would gain noise without signal. If the deprecation queue grows post-1.0 graduation (or post-mobile bump if a new deprecation lands), the scan can be added as a focused iterate-tier fix at that point. No standalone phase warranted.

### Candidate: Agent verify reporter polish bundle
- rejected: 2026-05-19 (oversight; superseded by /iterate)
- reason: All 5 items in the candidate's scope shipped via /iterate ticks after Phase 40 closed, under the standing reporter bias. Specifically: (1) `rollup.callouts: string[]` heuristics → `886b862`; (2) slow-failed-tests surface (`slowestFailures: [{name, file, durationMs, status}]`) → `1dbce81`; (3) per-test `location` via `experimental_getRunnerTask` → `8fe314b` (with the lazy-dynamic-import polish at `a799e75`); (4) `--reporter=default` chained alongside the custom reporter → `934cee6`; (5) `durationMs` integer rounding → `5401de4`. The combined-score-15.5 drain happened in 5 commits rather than 1 phase, but the schema is now settled and the reporter polish queue is empty. No follow-on phase needed; future reporter work would be a feature add, not a polish bundle.

### Candidate: Combat sub-event surfacing in agent-e2e state log
- rejected: 2026-05-15 (oversight; redundant after iterate)
- reason: /iterate at `5ac6caa` drained the underlying MED critique row
  by extending `EnginePayload` with optional `combatEvents?: readonly
  RoundEvent[]`, threading the array through `store.updateCombat(combat,
  combatEvents)` onto the `combat:round` event payload, and surfacing
  it on the `combatRound` state-log entry from `src/CLI/game.cli.ts`.
  Two hermetic tests in `src/Game/e2e/events.engine.test.ts` pin the
  wire. The candidate scope was a strict subset of what shipped — no
  follow-on phase needed.
