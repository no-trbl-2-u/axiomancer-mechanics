## Done

- [x] **[HIGH] src/CLI/combat.display.ts is 968 LOC of dead code orphaned by Phase 17** — resolved at commit `0e7e8a9` (2026-05-15) by `git rm src/CLI/combat.display.ts`. Phase 17 deleted `combat.cli.ts` but missed this companion helper file; zero consumers in src/, automation/, or scripts/.
- [x] **[LOW] Empty committed directory: src/Game/backups/** — closed at commit 8deedeb (2026-05-15) as misdiagnosed. `git ls-files src/Game/backups/` is empty — git does not track empty directories, so the "committed directory" framing in the original finding was wrong. The directory existed only in local working trees and was not in the repository. Deleted the local instance; a fresh clone is unaffected.
- [x] **[LOW] northern-forest map has placeholder description `'TODO'`** — resolved at commit 7623ffc (2026-05-15) by replacing the literal in `src/World/Continents/Coastal-Village/maps.ts` with a one-line description matching the fishing-village tone: "A pine-thick wood inland from the village; cold springs, low light, and a cave mouth at the far edge."
- [x] **[MED] Game/persistence has zero tests despite owning the save-file format** — resolved at commit `81d6dbe` (2026-05-15) by adding `src/Game/persistence/node.adapter.test.ts` (4 hermetic cases: round-trip save/load, missing file, malformed JSON warns + nulls out, overwrite).
- [x] **[MED] combat.resolver.ts is 1000 lines — phase logic is unsplit** — resolved at commit `48c56be` (2026-05-15) by extracting `phases/round-start.ts`, `phases/action-restriction.ts`, `phases/advantage.ts`, `phases/stance-effects.ts`, `phases/scenario.ts`, `phases/round-end.ts`; orchestrator shrunk from 1,012 LOC to 301 LOC.
- [x] **[HIGH] Typed event payloads diverge from runtime shape — guards are fictional** — resolved in Phase 21 at commit `a3f1693` (2026-05-15) by aligning `Typed*Event` payloads to the engine's actual `EnginePayload` envelope (`{ action, state, report? }`); guards in `events.utils.ts` now narrow to a shape the engine actually produces.
- [x] **[MED] Phase 12 left Node adapter duplicate-exported on the core barrel** — resolved at commit `e478bdd` (2026-05-15) by removing `createNodeAdapter` from `src/index.ts` and `src/Game/index.ts`; concrete adapter lives only at `'./node'`, interface (`PersistenceAdapter`) stays on the core barrel for RN consumers.
- [x] **[MED] Phase 12 typed event surface covers only 7 of 10 GameEventType values** — resolved at commit `a3f1693` (2026-05-15) by introducing the generic `TypedGameEvent<T extends GameEventType>` and emitting per-topic aliases for all 10 topics (`dialogue:applied`, `game:saved`, `game:loaded` now covered).
- [x] **[MED] Typed event creators are exported but never produced inside the engine** — resolved at commit `a3f1693` (2026-05-15) by deleting the seven `create*Event` factories; the engine emits via the store's dispatch path and consumer-side fabrication has no use case.
- [x] **[LOW] events.utils.ts uses redundant `as Payload` casts on literal payloads** — resolved at commit `a3f1693` (2026-05-15); the cast sites went with the deleted factories.
- [x] **[LOW] Hermetic e2e layout is half-adopted across modules** — resolved at commit `bb369c1` (2026-05-15) by moving `Effects/index.test.ts → Effects/e2e/effects.engine.test.ts`, `Enemy/enemy.logic.test.ts → Enemy/e2e/enemy.engine.test.ts`, `World/spec08.test.ts → World/e2e/world.engine.test.ts`, and updating bearings to formalize the e2e + sibling-unit convention.
- [x] **[HIGH] NPCs — exported dialogue runtime has no tests** — resolved at commit `00cda59` (2026-05-13) by adding `src/NPCs/e2e/dialogue.engine.test.ts` (13 hermetic cases).
- [x] **[HIGH] Character — zero module-level tests for public API** — resolved at commit `8e20626` (2026-05-13) by adding `src/Character/e2e/character.engine.test.ts` (16 hermetic cases).
- [x] **[MED] docs/npcs.md is stale** — resolved at commit `1193b19` (2026-05-13) by rewriting `docs/npcs.md` against the live Spec 08 Q9 dialogue surface (helpers, DialogueContext, applyDialogueChoice cross-link, accurate Pending section).
- [x] **[MED] Tests bypass test-utils/rng.ts and stub Math.random directly** — resolved at commit `6b5ea3f` (2026-05-13) by routing 3 call sites through `mockSequentialRng` and updating stale header comments in `src/Enemy/loot.ts` and `src/Combat/combat.resolver.ts`.
- [x] **[LOW] Dead code: src/Items/_archive/ (1,104 LOC)** — resolved at commit `cdcc630` (2026-05-13) by deleting the archive directory and dropping the corresponding `tsconfig.json` / `vitest.config.ts` exclude entries.
