# Brain Dump — Unorganized Ideas

## Difficulty System
- No upfront difficulty selection.
- Difficulty is a meter driven by moral choices:
  - Moral choices increase it; immoral choices decrease it.
- Example: Escort a child from start to end.
  - Opens one possible ending, but closes another.
  - Having someone murder the child: the only path to the happy ending is to forgive the murderer.

## Combat — Tier 2 Synergy
- Tier 1 effects reward repeating the same ActionType. Tier 2 should reward switching.
- Add skills that get bonuses based on the **duration or intensity** of an effect already on the field.

**Example A — Duration cross-type:**
Enemy has 5 rounds of poison. Player uses a different ActionType skill that doubles poison duration.
If the post-doubled duration is ≥ 5, deal bonus damage equal to the new duration.

**Example B — Buff type-swap:**
Player has 5+ rounds of Thorns (Body). Uses a Heart skill to convert Thorns to a heart-typed effect.
If duration ≥ 5, Thorns become a Bat Swarm: instead of dealing reflected damage, it heals the player based on the remaining duration.
