# Brain Dump - Unorganized ideas

## Ideas for Difficulty
- No difficulty choice in the beginning
  - Instead, difficulty is a meter based off choices
    - Moral choices make it go up
    - Immoral choices make it go down 
  - Example: Escort a child from start to end
    - While it may open up one possible ending, it forces the end of another
    - Have somebody murder the child, ONLY way to get happy ending is to forgive the murderer
